		<text>PASTORS CANT COMPETE WITH
	CHARLEY CHAPLIN
	Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
	Chaplin" sermons were called "im
	possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
	Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
	fore the Woman's Board of Missions
	of the Interior, which closed here to
	day. "There has been much talk about
	making sermons interesting," said
	the speaker. "We never can make
	sermons as interesting as melo
	dramas or prayer meetings as amus
	ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
	were meant to be so.
	"If a heathen dropped into New
	York and saw a church with a seating
	capacity of 1,500, attended by about
	200 on Sunday and dark six days a
	week, he would never go back with
	the impression that the United States
	was a Christian nation."</text>

	_ IFFLE
	Charlie Chaplin is going
	to get $87 0,000 this year for
	making a fool of himself.
	And just think of the num
	ber of would-be ball tossers
	who do the same thing for
	nothing every training sea
	son.
	Mills, Oh Mills! You're quite
	contrary,
	Won't 'low boxing here no mo';
	Why not let the square guys
	try it,
	Just to make the other kind
	■ore?
	You might put a stop to prize
	fight grafting,
	Allow the fans to see good
	sport;
	Tell the duo in the tower
	They must sail clean from this
	port.
	Poetry bubbles from our
	lips Just like aen.ua from thee
	Broadway fountain.RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
	Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
	actor in the world, is appearing
	at the Melbourne and Liberty to
	day in the same picture, "His
	First Vacation.'' Never before
	has the same actor appeared in
	the same picture at two Tacoma
	movies at the same time.
	It is an evidence of the keen
	rivalry between movie men. The
	Melbourne had signed the film
	for next week. The Liberty, how
	ever, obtained the same picture
	for the latter half of this week.
	Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
	bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
	order for his film yesterday when
	he heard of the Libertys' move,
	and obtained his copy of tlie film
	by express yesterday. He put it
	on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-
	Tlie picture remains at both
	houses until tomorrow night.
	CHAPLIN AT
	LIBERTY
	The old favrolte — Charlie
	Chaplin—who has returned to
	the IJberty.
	Movie fans who see Charlie
	Chaplin this week at the Liberty
	will not only see the world's
	greatest comedian in action, after
	a long vacation, but will witness
	the work of a man who gets
	$670,000 a year for being foolish.
	Chaplin recently signed with Mu
	tual at this price. His Liberty
	film, "His First Vacation," is
	added to the regular bill of "The
	Innocence of Ruth,' a clever
	;crook drama.

        Charlie Chaplin the real one may
        remain in Honolulu for a short time,
        but Charlie Chaplin the reel one is
        almost a permanent fixture. Provided
        the management of the Hawaii thea
        ter can s'o arrange, C. C. will be a
        perpetual attraction.
        There is little difference with C. C.
        as to the title of his attractions. Just
        so long as the leading comedian of
        the screen is in the billing Honolulu
        and every other city in the world will
        turn out almost en masse. i ne cur
        rent Chaplin attraction at the Hawaii
        happens to be entitled "The foreman,"
        and the title is a good one as it is
        an excuse for Chaplin himself to ap- j
        near for a couple of reels of laugh J
        production. As is customary with
        Chaplin's films there is nothing to it -
        but laughter, although that commo

        CHARLIE CHAPLIN, AND
        SAILS AWAY FOR HIL0
        Boyishly beaming with satisfaction
        at the great crowd present, Charlie
        Chaplin reeled up the gangway or the
        Mauna Kea Saturday afternoon before
        departing for his visit to the volcano.

        the many children present could not
        be convinced that their screen idol
        had really come to life in Honolulu
        until the comedian twisted his ears,
        wrinkled his face and let his feet per
        form. Then there was a chorus of
        childish voices shouting, "bee Char

        Cliarlie had scarcely boarded the
        steamer until lfe and Demosthenes
        Lycurgus had established an entente
        and posed with arms locked for a
        squad of amateur photographers. Due
        to "Monty's" plentiful proiwrtions
        there was grave danger of the Vol
        cano hotel manager "hogging the
        camera," until Charlie was placed on
        the weather, or camera, side.
        As the Mauna Kea pulled into thqi
        stream, the screen comedian waved
        a red bouquet, tiped his white flan
        nel hat, shuffled three dance step3,
        did a" donkey" with his cars, smiled
        his Roosevelt smile, teeth and all,

        Photographers camped on his trail
        and snapped him riding tho sivf

        tho hula girls and even flirting with
        Polo, tho Goddess of Fire, on the
        odgo of tho Volcano at Kllauoa.
        It Is expected that ns soon as his
        contracts permit ho will bring over
        a company and bo filmod with an
        Hawaiian setting which will bo uni

        they returned to tho mainland, Oc
        tober 17, tired, but happy.
        Charlie Chaplin, movlo king, small

        Capturing Charlie Chaplin
        By Harriette Underhill
        Once upon a time we did not love
        Charlie Chaplin. It was not so long
        ago, either?not more than two years?
        and it was when all movie houses re?
        leasing his pictures had those horrible
        wooden effigies of him in the lobby.
        This may have helped to prejudice us.
        At any rate, we used to glory in the
        story of the nice old lady who went tim?
        idly up to the box office and said: "Ex?
        cuse me, "but is Charlie Chaplin's pict?
        ure showing here?" "Yes, ?madam," re?
        plied the box office man. "Going on at
        2 o'clock." "Thank you," replies the
        n. o. 1. "Then I won't go in." We al?
        ways quoted that nice old lady and
        never felt that we were really under?
        stood unless we could find some one to
        talk to who didn't like Charlie, either.
        This was not so difficult at first, but
        we felt that we were rapidly losing our
        very best supporters, and hardly a day
        passed but some one of them went over
        to the pro-Charlies. Then along came
        Heywood Broun, "our favorite dramatic
        critic," saying that Charlie Chaplin was
        screamingly funny and an artist. We
        began to weaken.
        First we went to see a Chaplin pict?
        ure with an unbiassed mind. Then we
        went to see another one voluntarily,
        and then we fell to wondering how long
        we must wait for the next to be re?
        leased.
        Four days ago we saw Charlie Chap?
        lin talking to a man in front of Clar
        idge'8, and we became incoherent with
        excitement. It was the first time we
        ever had seen him off the screen, and
        we were immediately stricken with in
        terviewitis. Stage and screen persons
        have come to be merely subjects. They
        are good, bad or indifferent?mostly in?
        different?but Charlie was a prize not
        to bo ignored.
        The fact that he was avoiding pub?
        licity and had refused to see all inter?
        viewers made the thing so much more
        interesting. The most he could do
        would be to deny his identity and say:
        "Madam, how daro you! I am not that
        sort of person." But fortunately his
        countenance was not as inscrutable as
        that of the hotel clerk up at the Ritz,
        where Charlie has his modest little
        three rooms and five baths. But more
        of that hotel clerk later.
        At any rate, we decided to sacrifice
        everything on the altar of duty, so we
        went straight up to the great and only
        Charles and just as we were about to
        pluck him by the sleeve and say, "Ex?
        cuse me, Mr. Chaplin, I'm the person
        who has been writing such nice things
        about you," we discovered ?hat the
        man he. was talking to was the man
        who writes the second best movie re?
        views in town.
        Of course, even with a proper intro?
        duction it was a bit disconcerting ?to
        meet your screen idol so suddenly,
        without his shoes or his cane or his
        hat, and yet we knew him immediately.
        Wo apologized for the interruption,
        mentally deciding that wild horses
        couldn't drag us away until we had had
        a chance to find out just how Charlie
        Chaplin talked, how he thought, how
        he dressed and how he looked.
        He talks humorously, he thinks se?
        riously, he dresses quietly and he
        looks handsome. He has the whitest
        teeth we ever saw, the bluest eyes and
        the blackest eyelashes. "How did you
        know me?" inquired Mr. Chaplin
        naively. "Why, you look just like your
        pictures," wo answered truthfully.
        "Not my pictures on the screen, I
        hope?" said Charlie. "Oh, no," said
        we. "But, you know, occasionally one
        does see a photograph of you in a
        magazine." "Oh, I see," said Charlie.
        "Such is fame." And then we said
        pleadingly, "Won't you please let us
        interview you?" To which he replied:
        "You know, I haven't seen a person
        nor talked to any one, but if you'll
        promise not to say anything about my
        work for the government, why?all
        right."
        He looked terribly suspicious. Just
        as though we were not taking more of
        a chance than he was. Hadn't we seen
        him drop ice cream down a lady's neck
        and get her involved in a revolving
        door and trip her up with his cane?
        And how could we tell what moment
        he might pull a dog out of his. trousers
        pocket or drop an egg out of his hat on
        our new suit?
        But he told us that he never again
        would pull a dog out of his trousers
        pocket, because Mutt, who co-starred
        with his master in "A Dog's Life," is
        dead, and no other ever shall take his
        place. When Charlie came East he
        left Mutt behind, and to, being only a
        dog, Mutt refused to forget his beloved
        friend. He starved himself to death
        and was buried on the 29th of April.
        "Every one told Mutt that I would
        Burely return, but perhaps he didn't
        understand, or perhaps he didr?'t be?
        lieve them. At any rate, he never would
        ] eat after the last time I fed him, and
        the inscription on his tombston^ reads:
        'Mutt, died April 29?a broken heart.'"
        We talked to Mr. Chaplin for an
        hour, and then he suddenly remem?
        bered that he had to go out and make
        a speech on the subject which we
        promised not to mention. And he told
        us about how much better he likes the
        West than he does the East, and ad?
        mitted that he could play the 'cello
        and the violin and the piano, and thst
        he had worked for two-and-six a week
        in London, and that he didn't know
        why people laughed at him, and how
        he first walked his famous walk. The
        other things which we learned about
        Chaplin are probably known to every
        one who knows Charlie.</text>

		<text>PASTORS CANT COMPETE WITH
	CHARLEY CHAPLIN
	Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
	Chaplin" sermons were called "im
	possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
	Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
	fore the Woman's Board of Missions
	of the Interior, which closed here to
	day. "There has been much talk about
	making sermons interesting," said
	the speaker. "We never can make
	sermons as interesting as melo
	dramas or prayer meetings as amus
	ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
	were meant to be so.
	"If a heathen dropped into New
	York and saw a church with a seating
	capacity of 1,500, attended by about
	200 on Sunday and dark six days a
	week, he would never go back with
	the impression that the United States
	was a Christian nation."</text>

	_ IFFLE
	Charlie Chaplin is going
	to get $87 0,000 this year for
	making a fool of himself.
	And just think of the num
	ber of would-be ball tossers
	who do the same thing for
	nothing every training sea
	son.
	Mills, Oh Mills! You're quite
	contrary,
	Won't 'low boxing here no mo';
	Why not let the square guys
	try it,
	Just to make the other kind
	■ore?
	You might put a stop to prize
	fight grafting,
	Allow the fans to see good
	sport;
	Tell the duo in the tower
	They must sail clean from this
	port.
	Poetry bubbles from our
	lips Just like aen.ua from thee
	Broadway fountain.RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
	Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
	actor in the world, is appearing
	at the Melbourne and Liberty to
	day in the same picture, "His
	First Vacation.'' Never before
	has the same actor appeared in
	the same picture at two Tacoma
	movies at the same time.
	It is an evidence of the keen
	rivalry between movie men. The
	Melbourne had signed the film
	for next week. The Liberty, how
	ever, obtained the same picture
	for the latter half of this week.
	Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
	bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
	order for his film yesterday when
	he heard of the Libertys' move,
	and obtained his copy of tlie film
	by express yesterday. He put it
	on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-
	Tlie picture remains at both
	houses until tomorrow night.
	CHAPLIN AT
	LIBERTY
	The old favrolte — Charlie
	Chaplin—who has returned to
	the IJberty.
	Movie fans who see Charlie
	Chaplin this week at the Liberty
	will not only see the world's
	greatest comedian in action, after
	a long vacation, but will witness
	the work of a man who gets
	$670,000 a year for being foolish.
	Chaplin recently signed with Mu
	tual at this price. His Liberty
	film, "His First Vacation," is
	added to the regular bill of "The
	Innocence of Ruth,' a clever
	;crook drama.

        Charlie Chaplin the real one may
        remain in Honolulu for a short time,
        but Charlie Chaplin the reel one is
        almost a permanent fixture. Provided
        the management of the Hawaii thea
        ter can s'o arrange, C. C. will be a
        perpetual attraction.
        There is little difference with C. C.
        as to the title of his attractions. Just
        so long as the leading comedian of
        the screen is in the billing Honolulu
        and every other city in the world will
        turn out almost en masse. i ne cur
        rent Chaplin attraction at the Hawaii
        happens to be entitled "The foreman,"
        and the title is a good one as it is
        an excuse for Chaplin himself to ap- j
        near for a couple of reels of laugh J
        production. As is customary with
        Chaplin's films there is nothing to it -
        but laughter, although that commo

        CHARLIE CHAPLIN, AND
        SAILS AWAY FOR HIL0
        Boyishly beaming with satisfaction
        at the great crowd present, Charlie
        Chaplin reeled up the gangway or the
        Mauna Kea Saturday afternoon before
        departing for his visit to the volcano.

        the many children present could not
        be convinced that their screen idol
        had really come to life in Honolulu
        until the comedian twisted his ears,
        wrinkled his face and let his feet per
        form. Then there was a chorus of
        childish voices shouting, "bee Char

        Cliarlie had scarcely boarded the
        steamer until lfe and Demosthenes
        Lycurgus had established an entente
        and posed with arms locked for a
        squad of amateur photographers. Due
        to "Monty's" plentiful proiwrtions
        there was grave danger of the Vol
        cano hotel manager "hogging the
        camera," until Charlie was placed on
        the weather, or camera, side.
        As the Mauna Kea pulled into thqi
        stream, the screen comedian waved
        a red bouquet, tiped his white flan
        nel hat, shuffled three dance step3,
        did a" donkey" with his cars, smiled
        his Roosevelt smile, teeth and all,

        Photographers camped on his trail
        and snapped him riding tho sivf

        tho hula girls and even flirting with
        Polo, tho Goddess of Fire, on the
        odgo of tho Volcano at Kllauoa.
        It Is expected that ns soon as his
        contracts permit ho will bring over
        a company and bo filmod with an
        Hawaiian setting which will bo uni

        they returned to tho mainland, Oc
        tober 17, tired, but happy.
        Charlie Chaplin, movlo king, small

        Capturing Charlie Chaplin
        By Harriette Underhill
        Once upon a time we did not love
        Charlie Chaplin. It was not so long
        ago, either?not more than two years?
        and it was when all movie houses re?
        leasing his pictures had those horrible
        wooden effigies of him in the lobby.
        This may have helped to prejudice us.
        At any rate, we used to glory in the
        story of the nice old lady who went tim?
        idly up to the box office and said: "Ex?
        cuse me, "but is Charlie Chaplin's pict?
        ure showing here?" "Yes, ?madam," re?
        plied the box office man. "Going on at
        2 o'clock." "Thank you," replies the
        n. o. 1. "Then I won't go in." We al?
        ways quoted that nice old lady and
        never felt that we were really under?
        stood unless we could find some one to
        talk to who didn't like Charlie, either.
        This was not so difficult at first, but
        we felt that we were rapidly losing our
        very best supporters, and hardly a day
        passed but some one of them went over
        to the pro-Charlies. Then along came
        Heywood Broun, "our favorite dramatic
        critic," saying that Charlie Chaplin was
        screamingly funny and an artist. We
        began to weaken.
        First we went to see a Chaplin pict?
        ure with an unbiassed mind. Then we
        went to see another one voluntarily,
        and then we fell to wondering how long
        we must wait for the next to be re?
        leased.
        Four days ago we saw Charlie Chap?
        lin talking to a man in front of Clar
        idge'8, and we became incoherent with
        excitement. It was the first time we
        ever had seen him off the screen, and
        we were immediately stricken with in
        terviewitis. Stage and screen persons
        have come to be merely subjects. They
        are good, bad or indifferent?mostly in?
        different?but Charlie was a prize not
        to bo ignored.
        The fact that he was avoiding pub?
        licity and had refused to see all inter?
        viewers made the thing so much more
        interesting. The most he could do
        would be to deny his identity and say:
        "Madam, how daro you! I am not that
        sort of person." But fortunately his
        countenance was not as inscrutable as
        that of the hotel clerk up at the Ritz,
        where Charlie has his modest little
        three rooms and five baths. But more
        of that hotel clerk later.
        At any rate, we decided to sacrifice
        everything on the altar of duty, so we
        went straight up to the great and only
        Charles and just as we were about to
        pluck him by the sleeve and say, "Ex?
        cuse me, Mr. Chaplin, I'm the person
        who has been writing such nice things
        about you," we discovered ?hat the
        man he. was talking to was the man
        who writes the second best movie re?
        views in town.
        Of course, even with a proper intro?
        duction it was a bit disconcerting ?to
        meet your screen idol so suddenly,
        without his shoes or his cane or his
        hat, and yet we knew him immediately.
        Wo apologized for the interruption,
        mentally deciding that wild horses
        couldn't drag us away until we had had
        a chance to find out just how Charlie
        Chaplin talked, how he thought, how
        he dressed and how he looked.
        He talks humorously, he thinks se?
        riously, he dresses quietly and he
        looks handsome. He has the whitest
        teeth we ever saw, the bluest eyes and
        the blackest eyelashes. "How did you
        know me?" inquired Mr. Chaplin
        naively. "Why, you look just like your
        pictures," wo answered truthfully.
        "Not my pictures on the screen, I
        hope?" said Charlie. "Oh, no," said
        we. "But, you know, occasionally one
        does see a photograph of you in a
        magazine." "Oh, I see," said Charlie.
        "Such is fame." And then we said
        pleadingly, "Won't you please let us
        interview you?" To which he replied:
        "You know, I haven't seen a person
        nor talked to any one, but if you'll
        promise not to say anything about my
        work for the government, why?all
        right."
        He looked terribly suspicious. Just
        as though we were not taking more of
        a chance than he was. Hadn't we seen
        him drop ice cream down a lady's neck
        and get her involved in a revolving
        door and trip her up with his cane?
        And how could we tell what moment
        he might pull a dog out of his. trousers
        pocket or drop an egg out of his hat on
        our new suit?
        But he told us that he never again
        would pull a dog out of his trousers
        pocket, because Mutt, who co-starred
        with his master in "A Dog's Life," is
        dead, and no other ever shall take his
        place. When Charlie came East he
        left Mutt behind, and to, being only a
        dog, Mutt refused to forget his beloved
        friend. He starved himself to death
        and was buried on the 29th of April.
        "Every one told Mutt that I would
        Burely return, but perhaps he didn't
        understand, or perhaps he didr?'t be?
        lieve them. At any rate, he never would
        ] eat after the last time I fed him, and
        the inscription on his tombston^ reads:
        'Mutt, died April 29?a broken heart.'"
        We talked to Mr. Chaplin for an
        hour, and then he suddenly remem?
        bered that he had to go out and make
        a speech on the subject which we
        promised not to mention. And he told
        us about how much better he likes the
        West than he does the East, and ad?
        mitted that he could play the 'cello
        and the violin and the piano, and thst
        he had worked for two-and-six a week
        in London, and that he didn't know
        why people laughed at him, and how
        he first walked his famous walk. The
        other things which we learned about
        Chaplin are probably known to every
        one who knows Charlie.</text>

	It' Grandmother's Recipe to
	Bring Back Color and
	Lustre to Hair.
	TffVbeautlfuJ, even ihnde of rlark,
	glossy Itair can only be had by brew
	ing a mixture of Sage Tea and Sul
	phur. Your batr is your charm. It
	makes or mars the face. When it
	fades, turns gray or streaked, just an
	application or two of Sage and Sul
	phur enhance ill appearance a hun
	dredfold. Don't bother to prepare the mix
	ture; you can get this famous old
	recine imnroved by the addition nf
	other ingredients at a small cost, all
	ready for use. It is called Wyrtlrs
	ige and Sulphur Compound. This
	can always be depended upon to bring
	back the natural color and lustre of
	your hair.
	Everybody uses "WyethV Sage nnd
	Sulphur Compound now because it
	darkens so naturally and evenly that
	nobody can tell it has been applied.
	You simply dampen a sponge or soft
	brush with it and draw this through
	the hair, taking one small strand at a
	time; by morning the gray hair has
	disappeared, and after another appli
	cation it becomes beautifully dark and
	appears glossy and lustrous. This
	ready-to-use preparation is a delightful

	Charlie Chaplin in a Care-Free, Gay S
	having Just the Way He Did Not,
	Says, So Far as She Was Conce
	NO recent case of broken romance and
	once fond hearts estranged has created
	such Interest as the suit for
	y divorce by Mrs. Charlie Chaplin against
	her husband, the world famous funny man
	of the motion pictures. The charges
	i brought by Mrs. Chaplin are "mental cruelty"
	and failure of her husband to provide
	for her. /
	Among the millions whom Charlie Chaplin
	has made laugh there l'"ve probably
	been msnv. wl'o hove thou?V*. how carefree
	and amusing the lot of the woman
	vas his wire. No wcma'.i, It would
	could ever have the toluss or be
	'ig but cheerful with so m.rthi~
	a companion. Yet strangely
	rre are no sadder, more posai'?
	than the professional humorni
	to use up all their store of

	"u. Charlie Chnnlln w.13 no exI?

	months in housekeeping expenses, although
	during that time Mrs. Chaplin herself
	was earning $1,000 a week.
	By Mr*. Charlie Chaplin
	(In an interview) <
	I AM quite ready to admit that my marriage
	to Charlie Chaplin was a mistake.
	It was a mistake on his part, because
	he is a genius, and geniuses should not
	I knarry. He would better be free and remain
	free, for he will make any 'woman he
	marries miserable, I know. J
	I We have been married for three years.
	Tor two of those years we lived under the1
	! same roof, more or less. That Is, if greeting
	a husband after long disappearances
	might be said to be living under t^e same
	L [roof with him.
	I If lying awake, weeping and wondering
	where your husband is, until 4 or 6 o'clock
	in the morning can really be called living.
	1 If wrangling over every bill that comes
	i in can be called Mving.
	If living on the scale of an income of
	$250 a week, when your husban<\ earns
	$13,000 a week, can be called living.
	If having your wardrobe censored and a
	standard of two or three dresses and one
	hat established may be considered an existence.
	If being told to Keep your head down
	to that no man will'see your face is living. .
	Tf hearing that meat and potatoes and
	i 'rtdlng are enough for a meal and that
	i ?? cream and salads are silly and useless
	iiMlv stands for proper living.
	V being constantly accused of flirting by
	n i'*n who Is causelessly Jealous Is living.
	*!', this and more I endured?and for
	; v? vn months. That Is the reason I hesit?te
	?o .'ay that we lived under the same
	, f. Tt wasn't living. It was perdition
	f- ?.
	U lias been said that a comedian Is only
	! i ,iy in public, I believe It. In fact, 1
	,< .W It. Chsrlle Chaplin, who has made
	ruil'lons laugh, only caused me tears.
	So It was better that we should separate,
	'letter that there be a divorce. 1 have
	KPsn htm since my suit for divorce began.
	We met in the office of my lawyer in L-os
	When we parted he said: "Mildred, you
	are right I should never have married.
	I know It now. Yon probably will marry
	soon. If rou do I hope you will be happy.
	I shall never marry again " And we
	looked at each other sadly?a funny man
	and his wife.
	That the public may not be misled by
	strange, false rumors I will tell for once
	nnrt finally, unless I tell It In court, the

	film specialty is tears, "sob stuff." And
	the news of the marriage 'was soon follow

	groom was not getting on very well with
	the tearful bride.
	Nobody seemed to know jti~t what was
	the matter but in due time Mrs. Chaplin
	admitted that she and her husband had
	separated. Then followed several state
	ments from Mrs. C'haplin but no comments
	came ifom Mr. Chaplin.
	At last the 'matrimonial troubles drifted
	into the Los Angeles courts. Mrs. (Chap

	A.-Well, when we %rere married Mr.
	Chaplin told me he wanted me to break
	the contract with the Pniversal, because
	he did not want me iorking with them.
	So, when I was in the hbspital, after I was
	first taken ill, I sent a written notice that
	I would not be with them any more and I
	was under age. My lawyer told me we
	could break the contract. Then, in Feb
	ruary. when I came back from Mt. Lowe.
	they had been sendjag me my check each
	-:eek, and I had been sending them back
	and they would return them again, but I
	had not cashed any. In February a friend
	of mine, Miss Bweet, asked me to go to
	New York with her when I came back
	from Mt. Lowe, and Mr. Chaplin had been
	away so long, and when he came back he
	said it would do me good to go to New
	York, so I wentt with her. But he wouldn't
	give me but $150.'and when I got East r
	bought a lot of baby clothes ad some baby
	furniture and a few other things, and I did
	not have enough money and I wired for
	more money. But he would not send me
	any more, so I wired mother to please
	ash one of my checks.
	Q.--That 'was the check that would re
	a-dirm your contract irith the Universal
	-eople, which he advised you to break?
	A-Yes, sir.
	Q.-Did you advise him with reference
	to your circumstances?
	A-Yes.
	Q.-DId you advise him that you expect
	ed to purchase some furniture for the ex
	pected child?
	A-Yes, sir.
	Q.-And he declined to send you any
	money at all?
	A.-Yes.
	Q.-And he was making apozimately
	16,000 or I7,000 a month at that time?
	A.-More than that.
	Q.-You mentioned the furniture. You
	say there was an arrangement made about
	snme turniture for the baby's room?
	A.-BDefore I went East Mr. Chaplin said
	Icould get a set of furniture for my room
	un in our home, because it was very dark.
	Q.-That was the room in which you
	were to be confined?
	A.-Yes, sir; my own roem. So. ?

	got back from he . York the room was all
	=urnished in thE aew furniture, ad he
	took me up to see it, and I was very happy
	about it aid he seemed to be quite pleased.
	but when the bfll came he refused to pay
	it. He said it was too expeasive and tat
	Ishould send it back.

	Famous Movie Comedian says
	London He Knew as Boy
	Does Not Exist Now
	BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN
	LONDON, Oct. 1. I always figure
	America under the symbol of youth
	vigorous, aggressive, full of hope and
	pen. courageous, and with the sun
	light of the morning shining in its
	eyes.
	I find England more like a serene
	old age mellowed by time, softened
	ly suffering, wise from long experi
	ence and with the. afterglow of the
	westering sun in its eyes.
	America, like all youth, has a core
	of hardness in its heart.
	England, like all mellowed old age
	has a core of tenderness in its heart.
	I should say America for work,
	England for thoughtful contempla
	tion and dreams. ,
	Of course, I know England is one of
	the mightiest nations in the world;
	that its hardy sons rule an empire;
	that they sail all seas and traffic In
	all markets. But I am merely trying
	to give my own impressions, to tell
	how the two countries 'affect me.
	I don't think I could do much work
	in England. Everything Is so finish
	ed, so settled, so restful that it would
	simply absorb' me.
	America Is Restless
	nut there Is in America a feeling of
	the unfinished, of restlessness that
	ius. makes one want to get up and do
	thjngs. That is why I am going back
	In a few weeks.
	It's all very nice to say that Chap
	lin brings laughter to men, but the
	truth is that Chaplin is working for
	his bread and cheese just like the
	rest of you. There is not much fun
	jn loafing too long.
	' I have been rediscovering England
	for myself aiyl contrasting my Im
	pressions of America and also with
	my memeories of the England I knew
	as a boy.
	' I came to America when I was 18
	und In the past 14 years have only
	been back home once. .
	My best experience has been to ram
	ble around the streets in the poor
	sections of London that I 'used
	know. I found in the mean streets
	something very lovely, something spir
	itunl. I nian as regards the people.
	There they were, living in misera
	ble ( tenements, their faces thin and
	pinehed from poor food, and yet there
	w something very beautiful in their
	eye.
	I. have never seen anything sweeter
	than the expression in the face of a
	girl out walking with her coster Tcrer.
	I began to understand how these
	poor people had suffered during the
	long years of the war and how thev
	had found the pluck to do it. and 1
	saw the mak rit had left on them. It
	was saddening as well as beautiful to
	get these -revelations.
	Had "Emotional Jag"
	Then I had an emotional jag. I
	prowled these poor streets in search
	or a wistful little bov I used to know
	a little, ill-dressed, rather fright
	ened Charlie Chaplin.
	Somehow. I couldn't quite catch up
	with him. The streets all seemed nar
	rower to me than they did to that
	little chap, and the crowds not quite
	so big and bustling, and the policemen
	not quite so terrifying.

	But I did see something we haven't
	got in America. eaw the mark Iof
	class distinction. The population In
	England Is really subdivided into real
	classes and castes. And being a very
	I old civilization and a very crowded
	country, it is hard for a man to get
	ou of his class.
	We have none of that in America.
	The workman of today still has the
	chance to be the captain of, industry
	of tomorrow. Why, the poor editor of
	yesterday is the president of today!
	America" is still in thd construction
	stage. She is not finished. That i
	why the builders, who are at work on
	the structure today, should be so very
	careful.
	It seems to me, looking back
	across the waters and across time,
	that America Is in a very critical pe
	riod. 1
	Finance is once, more in danger of
	falling into the 1 bands of the few we
	always call "Wall Street."
	And finance is adapting a taa Intol
	erant attitude toward labor. Labor
	should not be -asked to do all the giv
	ing un. Finance should give up a lit
	tle, also."
	There is a danger that if there is
	too much clash, a class feeling will
	develon which would be entirely un
	American. Too Much Organization
	I think "another danger to America
	is the number 'of organizations which
	are growing up which are anti-some-bodyq,
	anti-some religion or race or
	creed or free expression of thought.
	America can learn a lesson in this
	regard from old England. There is
	far greater personal liberty and far
	greater iibertv of speech in England
	than in America. .
	Since havle been over here I have
	seen it stated that I am a deep reader
	and that I am a Socialist. I would
	like to deny both statements. I am
	not a highbrow. I don't pretend to
	be. My only pretension is to be an
	rtist. I don't mix in, politics. And
	I am nol immersed in economic litera
	tu. " . " .. i
	I am neither, a Socialist 'nor a par
	lor Bolshevik. But I believe with all
	mv heart in social reform. I believe
	very strongly in municipal ownership
	of public utilities. I believe in the
	nationalization of the railways and
	probably of coai mines. ,

	i .5 there is this hidden scamp hero with
	whom Chaplin identifies himself and
	with whom the world of respectabilities
	??nd conventionalities is in conflict.
	Chaplin expresses for us an imaginary

	it by resolving it into a joke.

	bowl this secret and reveals it in
	Iiiis hook.
	Gar!...' Chaplin's book is from the
	psychological angle a remarkable hu?
	man document, greatly because of this
	revelation. It explains the appeal of
	this poor little feeble creature on the
	outglde of the great big world. To the
	reade?r unversed in psychology the
	outstanding features of the book are
	likely to be the triumphant return of
	Charlie Chaplin to the land of his birth
	his meetings with the great in poli?
	tics and letters his sympathy for the
	unfortunate his intimate confessions
	of his likes and dislikes. However, the
	real revelation lies in Charlie's visits
	to the haunts of his childhood.
	Trio whole tone of the book is that
	of a half lonely ?'dventurer visiting the
	scene:; of his early 1 i fr. reacting with
	genuine sympathy to every situation.
	We learn of Chaplin's early experi?
	ence as a little ragged urchin. On top
	of that, experience has been imposed
	this magical thing- for his succ?s?? has
	been like an Arabian Nights fantasy?
	and 1 doubt if he has ever quite real?
	ized tha' ?t vvas he who has had it.
	This little ragged urchin has stayed
	v.ith Chaplin all his life and is the
	main reason for his tremendous hu?
	man appeal.
	? ? ?
	OUR or five years ago ?ome neigh?
	bor child came rushing to me, all
	out of breath. She was all excited, for
	she was going to the Hippodrome to see
	"Charlie Chaplin himself.'' ?
	At thar time "Charlie Chaplin him-'
	self didn't mean any more to me than !
	Charlie in the, movies. But after read?
	ing his book T feel that I do know
	Charlie Chaplin himself. In another
	age. where he would have had to ap
	pear directly in person before his
	audiences, the chances are that the
	personal side of his art would have
	been more evident to the people, who
	are rather inclined to look down on
	the movies, anyhow, and who have re?
	garded Charlie Chaplin merely as a
	comedian who makes lots of money.
	The motion picture ,is a medium of
	expression is a syndicate sort of thing.
	It takes a tremendous amount of per?
	sonality to overcame the?" difficulties.
	] !. ? crowds who have bce'n rooting for
	Chaplin have been psychologically cor?
	rect. 'While he has an enormous popu?
	larity, he doesn't make an appeal to
	the crowd mind, but rather a secret

	What was Chaplin like?
	remember that I paid a large tax
	on my own income. In 1917, for
	instance, it was about 50 per cent.
	Some of the stars were per
	sonally just as fabulous charac
	ters as the fan magazines painted
	them. I was married to one
	Doughs Fairbanks. You could
	almost say that he went through
	life swinging from chandelier to
	chandelier, just as he did in his
	pictures. He wasn’t a show-off
	just naturally a joyous person.
	During our honeymoon abroad,
	we had dinner one night at the
	"Tour d’Argent” in Paris. Like
	every other guest there, I mar
	veled at the great view of Notre
	Dame Cathedral, and Doughs
	seemed impressed, too. He said,
	"You know, Mary. I think I can
	see enough hand-holds to climb
	all the way up that right-hand
	tower.”
	Daredevils Fairbanks and Ford
	One time in California Doughs
	and I visited Henry Ford’s home.
	I was awed by the dour old
	billionaire, but not Doughs. He
	jollied Mr. Ford outrageously and
	the two went out for a stroll
	on the estate. I stayed in the
	drawing room with Mrs. Ford,
	and when it came time to go, I
	went outside to find Doughs. He
	was sitting astride the ridgepole
	of the house, three stories up,
	and Henry Ford was sitting there
	with him, laughing fit to kill.
	When I got Doughs alone, 1
	really lit into him.
	"Perfectly safe,” he protested.
	"I tried the hand-holds twice
	before I let him go up.”
	It certainly was an era of fabu
	lous nonsense! But at least it was
	fun and it was harmless. The fans
	saw to that! A breath of scandal
	that touched a star could ruin
	~jjtSk<RU*r
	him. The standards were so strict
	that they were sometimes grossly .
	unfair: When a famous director,
	William Desmond Taylor was
	mysteriously murdered, Mabel
	Normand’s career was blighted,
	though she had no connection
	with the murder at all she had
	merely been going out with
	Taylor.
	The truth about Charlie
	I mentioned that many of the
	Hollywood stars of yesterday were
	characters born almost of fan
	tasy. But of course many weren’t,
	and surprisingly enough, Charlie
	Chaplin was one of the latter. The
	one question that people ask more
	than any other is: "What was
	Charlie Chaplin like?” The an
	swer: "When Charlie wasn’t act
	ing, he tended to be a bore.”
	Charlie was the star of any
	party as long as he was doing his
	parlor "bits.” But whenever he
	wasn’t performing, he could be
	very tiresome. He was forever
	launching into long lectures on
	dry subjects. One of his obses
	sions was the British monetary
	system and how he proposed to
	reform it.
	But regardless of how one may
	feel about Charlie Chaplin as a
	person, nobody furthered the
	story-book tradition more than he
	did. Wis old silent movies were
	nuuterpierei of make-believe,
	ereryoneoj thorn worth • dozen
	modem triumph* of realism.
	I'm not suggesting that realism
	isn’t good. But I do suggest very
	strongly that if we Americans and
	our entertainment keep on get
	ting any more sophisticated and
	hard-bitten, we might someday
	lose one of the greatest of all
	human arts: the art of believing
	in make-believe. The M

	Says:
	“And the enormous crowds left the theatre with every emotion, from hysterical
	gales of laughter to the stifled sobs of sympathy, completely exhausted.
	“That was the experience of the audience at the New York Strand theatre last night
	who went to the opening of Charlie Chaplin’s new film, ‘The Kid,’ First National’s six
	reels of joy. ‘Six reels of joy’ tells but half of it, for while the comedian has never
	been so mirth-provoking in any previous production, the story which is unfolded con
	tains more real heart-throbs than many a picture that has built up reputations for
	emotional actresses.
	“Charlie is himself, but he has injected himself into a story of heart interest that has
	seldom been equaled. The synopsis of it sounds rather trite, for it starts'with the
	abandonment of her baby by the woman who has been wronged. Charlie finds the
	baby and raises him to boyhood. The typical Chaplinesque methods of raising the
	Kid are responsible lor a good part of the humor with which the piece abounds,
	while his pitiable, whimsical procedure to gain the child’s love dampened many an
	eye. The dramatic climax of the film comes with Chaplin’s losing fight, and the
	Kid’s despair when the law separates them, but this is followed so closely by a bit
	of comedy which, perhaps, is the best of the piece, in which Charlie rescues him
	after a chase over roof tops, that people laugh the lumps right out of their throats.
	“If you love comedy you cannot afford to miss seeing “The Kid,” and if you enjoy
	being held enthralled in the grip of pathos, there is a treat awaiting after you go
	into the theatre where it is showing.”
	The daylight trials of motherhood, and the midnight
	trials of paternity are all for Chaplin in this super
	comedy. He is a good mother to the Kid, and when
	that Kid grows up he surely becomes a good son,
	for Charlie is a wondering glazier, and while the Kid
	goes ahead breaking windows, Charlie is always at
	hand to get the job of mending them. And yet there
	is a sob now and then; you never expected that of
	Charlie, did you.
	If You Love Comedy You Cannot Afford to Miss It.
	If you enjoy being held enthralled in the grip of pathos a treat awaits you</text>

	Cried Pola Negri in Tragic Earnestness.
	SCARCELY two years since Charlie Chaplin
	was divorced from Mildred Harris, is
	wife, and now his new romance wi
	German-Pole film star, Pola Negri, is clou e
	with trouble.
	The Polish nobleman, Count Dombski, has
	heard the news where he happens now to be in
	England and has announced that Pola Negri is
	still his wife and that Charlie Chaplin must face
	him in a duel if he dares to marry Pola Negri.
	It would be a strange sight if the motion
	picture audiences could see the fiery Count
	Dombski rush forward, sword in hand, to make
	the great film comedian answer to him on the
	field of honor. But the threatened duel is hardly
	likely to happen where the movie cameras can photograph it.
	x Charlie Chaplin is very handy with that cane of his. Is it
	possible that Mr. Chaplin would take a humorous view of the
	wild-eyed Polish Count and would give him a lesson in fencing
	with his cane? z ~
	The film audiences have seen Mr. Chaplin wiggle away from
	all sorts of threatening situations and,-again and again, that
	handy cane has tripped up policemen and detectives and big
	bullies. But that was on the screen. What would Charlie do
	rn a real life encounter with Count Dombski and his sharp-edged
	S "°ln the recent news from the interesting lovers Pola Negri
	has sebmed to be rather more demonstrative than Mr. Chaplin.
	The expressions that have come from the comedian have seemed
	to be rather conservative, as if, perhaps, he had some anxieties
	or misgivings in the back of his nead. Has Charlie Chaplin re
	ceived a warning that he will be held to account on the field of
	honor if he takes Pola Negri as a bride?
	Pola Negri is a very attractive woman, and it is not surpris
	ing that a man who was lucky enough to once possess her would
	fight valiantly not to lose her. Very little has been revealed as
	to the exact facts of Pola Negri’s marriage to Count Dombski, or
	just when, where, and under what circumstances the divorce
	was secured which Pola Negri relies upon to make it possible
	for her to marry Charlie Chaplin.
	But the interview quoted above with Count, Dombski was
	secured by a British newspaper, and if Count Dombski makeg
	good his threat to come to America and require an accounting
	at the hands of Charlie Chaplin, a very interesting situation
	will develop.
	Whether Count Dombski is now cn his way to America to
	settle things with the film comedian and his runaway wife has
	not been announced. It is possible that Count Dombski may
	be arranging his affairs in a leisurely manner and may not
	arrive until after the marriage takes place.
	Whatever Count Dombski may be planning to do, there is

	little doubt that the Polish nobleman is a man of vigorous per
	sonality and violent manner. He is an excellent swordsman and
	a very good shot with the pistol.
	Pola Negri herself, in telling of her romance and carriage
	to Count Dombski, explains that he was so violently opposed to
	having his wife continue working in the studios that he forbade
	her to go on with her contracts with the Berlin movie producers.
	“The parting of the ways came one night a few months
	.after we were married,” she said, “when I was making one of
	my periodic stays at Count Dombski’s castle at Sassnowiece, in
	Poland. A telegram arrived about midnight, calling me back to
	the Berlin studio, and when I showed it to my husband he flew
	into a violent rage.
	“Drawing his revolver, he told me that if I left for Berlin
	it would be over his dead body. Knowing how he felt about the
	matter, I recalled that the climax had been reached and that he
	might do something desperate. So I told him 1 would remain.
	“But that night, after he had gone to sleep, I got up and
	dressed and, taking only such clothes as I could carry in my
	arms, I left the castle, never to return.
	“How I reached the railway station at Sassnowiece after my
	escape is still a mystery to me. I must have walked and run
	miles in the darkness. But my mind was made up—my career
	came first, cost what it may. And, as luck would have it, there
	was a train for Berlin almost ready to depart when I arrived
	at the station —the spot where our romance had begun nearly
	a year before.” ...
	The lady who says she is no longer Countess Dombski, and is
	eager to be Mrs. Charles Chaplin, is most emphatic on the
	points at issue between her and the Count. “I deny that I
	am the wife of the Count, and I challenge him to try to assert
	his supposed rights in any court in the world. I have the
	proper decree dissolving the marriage,” she insists.
	“I am told that it is in proper form in all respects, and
	that there is nothing to bind me to the Count. I am as free
	as ever I,was, and he cannot stop me marrying the man of
	Great Britain Bights Uesrrved.

	“Charlie and I love each other. We are made for eatfl
	other, and we intend to seek happiness together < until death '
	alone parts us. .Charlie sought me out among the artists of tho
	world, and helped me to achieve greater fame than 1 enjoyed
	up to then. We found that we were not only soul mates, but
	that we had the temperament in our art that made tho one
	Tthe complement of the other, and we both think that In associa
	tion we can achieve our greatest and best work.”
	At Los Angeles she appears everywhere Charlie is to bo
	seen, and goes around with the triumphant air of the woman
	in possession who will not surrender her rights to the film
	artist under any circumstances.
	“There is no law that can keep us apart,” she says. “Wo
	are masters of. our own fate, and we shall not be prevented
	from uniting our lives by ahy one. I love only Charlie in tho
	world. He is my ting among men, and I will marry him in
	spite of everything and everybody who tries to come between
	us all.”
	Mr. Chaplin is less defiant, and at times has the appearance
	of being uncomfortable under the aggressive manner in which
	he is claimed as her- affinity by the lady who seems to have
	discovered in him the perfect lover immediately after he found
	in her the perfect film star.
	Mlle. Pola Negri, when questioned regarding the suggestion
	that she as a Roman Catholic could hardly claim the right to
	remarry after divorce, replied rather vaguely:
	“On that there is a good deal of misunderstanding. I can
	only tell you that I have taken the best -advice from legal and
	spiritual advisers, and there is no real barrier to our marriage
	if we decide to go through with it. •
	“Fate brought Charlie and' me into contact, and we should
	be foolish to run pway from our happiness decreed by fate.
	He was on his way back to America when he was shown a
	film in which I appeared.
	“He said to,the person who showed the film, ‘Why, this is
	the artiste I have been looking for since I first went into the
	film business.’ I received a telegram soon after asking if I
	would meet him.
	“I did not know him except by name, and I did not think
	I should like him, so I said ‘No.’ But in spite of that he came
	and I realized at once that he was altogether different to what
	I had expected, for not only was he a great actor but he was
	a real man in every sense of the word.
	“I found myself won over by his charming manners, and I
	felt that I had at last found the man to whose keeping I could
	surrender, my heart, my life, and my future happiness without
	hesitation. Working with him makes a great deal of difference
	to me.
	“I feel that I can give a better expression to my heart
	under his eyes, and for his sake I try to surpass anything I
	have ever done before. I used to think that Charlie was fust
	what you call a clown, with no art and no message, but now I
	know that behind his clowning there is a real art and a real
	message, if only those who see nis films would understand them.
	“Charlie seeks to portray the- life of ‘Les of
	the great cities and to arouse the comfortable classes to their
	duties and responsibilities to the less fortunate.”
	The story of the beginning of the Chaplin-Negri romance
	is very interesting.
	Charlie was shown some, of the films of the lady in London
	and again in Paris. He liked them so well that he must needs
	rush to Berlin and then to Vienna to see the artiste for himself.
	“A veritable queen of the movies, the most perfect acting
	features I ever seen, capable of expressing every con
	ceivable shade of emotion with the skill and grace of the true
	artiste,” he exclaimed.
	These were among the eulogies passed by Charlie on the
	lady as an artiste, but later he had something to say of her as
	a worn in, as a beauty, and as a charmer of hearts. * She has
	all the qualities of form and soul that fit a woman to reign
	over the heart of a man and to be his greatest inspiration in
	whatever he regards as his life work,” he declared. I
	And Pola Negri was no less lavish in what She said of
	Charlie. “A man that any woman could love, could work with
	as life partner, and feel honored in doing so, finding her true
	happiness in association with his life.,” she declared.
	“He has the true soul of an artiste and is an ideal lover
	with the capacity for making even the most capricious woman
	happy,” were among the things she said of him, and after
	this semi-public love-making, it was only to be expected that
	the rapturous crowds of admirers should be eager to lead the
	happy pair to the altar in order that their lives might be united
	for better or for worse. . . . ,
	Will Count Dombski cool off and let things take their course
	or will he turn up in America and ask Charlie Chaplin to meet
	him on the field of honor? And then what?</text>

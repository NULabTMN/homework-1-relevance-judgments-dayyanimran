		<text>PASTORS CANT COMPETE WITH
	CHARLEY CHAPLIN
	Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
	Chaplin" sermons were called "im
	possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
	Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
	fore the Woman's Board of Missions
	of the Interior, which closed here to
	day. "There has been much talk about
	making sermons interesting," said
	the speaker. "We never can make
	sermons as interesting as melo
	dramas or prayer meetings as amus
	ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
	were meant to be so.
	"If a heathen dropped into New
	York and saw a church with a seating
	capacity of 1,500, attended by about
	200 on Sunday and dark six days a
	week, he would never go back with
	the impression that the United States
	was a Christian nation."</text>

	_ IFFLE
	Charlie Chaplin is going
	to get $87 0,000 this year for
	making a fool of himself.
	And just think of the num
	ber of would-be ball tossers
	who do the same thing for
	nothing every training sea
	son.
	Mills, Oh Mills! You're quite
	contrary,
	Won't 'low boxing here no mo';
	Why not let the square guys
	try it,
	Just to make the other kind
	■ore?
	You might put a stop to prize
	fight grafting,
	Allow the fans to see good
	sport;
	Tell the duo in the tower
	They must sail clean from this
	port.
	Poetry bubbles from our
	lips Just like aen.ua from thee
	Broadway fountain.RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
	Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
	actor in the world, is appearing
	at the Melbourne and Liberty to
	day in the same picture, "His
	First Vacation.'' Never before
	has the same actor appeared in
	the same picture at two Tacoma
	movies at the same time.
	It is an evidence of the keen
	rivalry between movie men. The
	Melbourne had signed the film
	for next week. The Liberty, how
	ever, obtained the same picture
	for the latter half of this week.
	Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
	bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
	order for his film yesterday when
	he heard of the Libertys' move,
	and obtained his copy of tlie film
	by express yesterday. He put it
	on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-
	Tlie picture remains at both
	houses until tomorrow night.
	CHAPLIN AT
	LIBERTY
	The old favrolte — Charlie
	Chaplin—who has returned to
	the IJberty.
	Movie fans who see Charlie
	Chaplin this week at the Liberty
	will not only see the world's
	greatest comedian in action, after
	a long vacation, but will witness
	the work of a man who gets
	$670,000 a year for being foolish.
	Chaplin recently signed with Mu
	tual at this price. His Liberty
	film, "His First Vacation," is
	added to the regular bill of "The
	Innocence of Ruth,' a clever
	;crook drama.

        Charlie Chaplin the real one may
        remain in Honolulu for a short time,
        but Charlie Chaplin the reel one is
        almost a permanent fixture. Provided
        the management of the Hawaii thea
        ter can s'o arrange, C. C. will be a
        perpetual attraction.
        There is little difference with C. C.
        as to the title of his attractions. Just
        so long as the leading comedian of
        the screen is in the billing Honolulu
        and every other city in the world will
        turn out almost en masse. i ne cur
        rent Chaplin attraction at the Hawaii
        happens to be entitled "The foreman,"
        and the title is a good one as it is
        an excuse for Chaplin himself to ap- j
        near for a couple of reels of laugh J
        production. As is customary with
        Chaplin's films there is nothing to it -
        but laughter, although that commo

        CHARLIE CHAPLIN, AND
        SAILS AWAY FOR HIL0
        Boyishly beaming with satisfaction
        at the great crowd present, Charlie
        Chaplin reeled up the gangway or the
        Mauna Kea Saturday afternoon before
        departing for his visit to the volcano.

        the many children present could not
        be convinced that their screen idol
        had really come to life in Honolulu
        until the comedian twisted his ears,
        wrinkled his face and let his feet per
        form. Then there was a chorus of
        childish voices shouting, "bee Char

        Cliarlie had scarcely boarded the
        steamer until lfe and Demosthenes
        Lycurgus had established an entente
        and posed with arms locked for a
        squad of amateur photographers. Due
        to "Monty's" plentiful proiwrtions
        there was grave danger of the Vol
        cano hotel manager "hogging the
        camera," until Charlie was placed on
        the weather, or camera, side.
        As the Mauna Kea pulled into thqi
        stream, the screen comedian waved
        a red bouquet, tiped his white flan
        nel hat, shuffled three dance step3,
        did a" donkey" with his cars, smiled
        his Roosevelt smile, teeth and all,

        Photographers camped on his trail
        and snapped him riding tho sivf

        tho hula girls and even flirting with
        Polo, tho Goddess of Fire, on the
        odgo of tho Volcano at Kllauoa.
        It Is expected that ns soon as his
        contracts permit ho will bring over
        a company and bo filmod with an
        Hawaiian setting which will bo uni

        they returned to tho mainland, Oc
        tober 17, tired, but happy.
        Charlie Chaplin, movlo king, small

        Capturing Charlie Chaplin
        By Harriette Underhill
        Once upon a time we did not love
        Charlie Chaplin. It was not so long
        ago, either?not more than two years?
        and it was when all movie houses re?
        leasing his pictures had those horrible
        wooden effigies of him in the lobby.
        This may have helped to prejudice us.
        At any rate, we used to glory in the
        story of the nice old lady who went tim?
        idly up to the box office and said: "Ex?
        cuse me, "but is Charlie Chaplin's pict?
        ure showing here?" "Yes, ?madam," re?
        plied the box office man. "Going on at
        2 o'clock." "Thank you," replies the
        n. o. 1. "Then I won't go in." We al?
        ways quoted that nice old lady and
        never felt that we were really under?
        stood unless we could find some one to
        talk to who didn't like Charlie, either.
        This was not so difficult at first, but
        we felt that we were rapidly losing our
        very best supporters, and hardly a day
        passed but some one of them went over
        to the pro-Charlies. Then along came
        Heywood Broun, "our favorite dramatic
        critic," saying that Charlie Chaplin was
        screamingly funny and an artist. We
        began to weaken.
        First we went to see a Chaplin pict?
        ure with an unbiassed mind. Then we
        went to see another one voluntarily,
        and then we fell to wondering how long
        we must wait for the next to be re?
        leased.
        Four days ago we saw Charlie Chap?
        lin talking to a man in front of Clar
        idge'8, and we became incoherent with
        excitement. It was the first time we
        ever had seen him off the screen, and
        we were immediately stricken with in
        terviewitis. Stage and screen persons
        have come to be merely subjects. They
        are good, bad or indifferent?mostly in?
        different?but Charlie was a prize not
        to bo ignored.
        The fact that he was avoiding pub?
        licity and had refused to see all inter?
        viewers made the thing so much more
        interesting. The most he could do
        would be to deny his identity and say:
        "Madam, how daro you! I am not that
        sort of person." But fortunately his
        countenance was not as inscrutable as
        that of the hotel clerk up at the Ritz,
        where Charlie has his modest little
        three rooms and five baths. But more
        of that hotel clerk later.
        At any rate, we decided to sacrifice
        everything on the altar of duty, so we
        went straight up to the great and only
        Charles and just as we were about to
        pluck him by the sleeve and say, "Ex?
        cuse me, Mr. Chaplin, I'm the person
        who has been writing such nice things
        about you," we discovered ?hat the
        man he. was talking to was the man
        who writes the second best movie re?
        views in town.
        Of course, even with a proper intro?
        duction it was a bit disconcerting ?to
        meet your screen idol so suddenly,
        without his shoes or his cane or his
        hat, and yet we knew him immediately.
        Wo apologized for the interruption,
        mentally deciding that wild horses
        couldn't drag us away until we had had
        a chance to find out just how Charlie
        Chaplin talked, how he thought, how
        he dressed and how he looked.
        He talks humorously, he thinks se?
        riously, he dresses quietly and he
        looks handsome. He has the whitest
        teeth we ever saw, the bluest eyes and
        the blackest eyelashes. "How did you
        know me?" inquired Mr. Chaplin
        naively. "Why, you look just like your
        pictures," wo answered truthfully.
        "Not my pictures on the screen, I
        hope?" said Charlie. "Oh, no," said
        we. "But, you know, occasionally one
        does see a photograph of you in a
        magazine." "Oh, I see," said Charlie.
        "Such is fame." And then we said
        pleadingly, "Won't you please let us
        interview you?" To which he replied:
        "You know, I haven't seen a person
        nor talked to any one, but if you'll
        promise not to say anything about my
        work for the government, why?all
        right."
        He looked terribly suspicious. Just
        as though we were not taking more of
        a chance than he was. Hadn't we seen
        him drop ice cream down a lady's neck
        and get her involved in a revolving
        door and trip her up with his cane?
        And how could we tell what moment
        he might pull a dog out of his. trousers
        pocket or drop an egg out of his hat on
        our new suit?
        But he told us that he never again
        would pull a dog out of his trousers
        pocket, because Mutt, who co-starred
        with his master in "A Dog's Life," is
        dead, and no other ever shall take his
        place. When Charlie came East he
        left Mutt behind, and to, being only a
        dog, Mutt refused to forget his beloved
        friend. He starved himself to death
        and was buried on the 29th of April.
        "Every one told Mutt that I would
        Burely return, but perhaps he didn't
        understand, or perhaps he didr?'t be?
        lieve them. At any rate, he never would
        ] eat after the last time I fed him, and
        the inscription on his tombston^ reads:
        'Mutt, died April 29?a broken heart.'"
        We talked to Mr. Chaplin for an
        hour, and then he suddenly remem?
        bered that he had to go out and make
        a speech on the subject which we
        promised not to mention. And he told
        us about how much better he likes the
        West than he does the East, and ad?
        mitted that he could play the 'cello
        and the violin and the piano, and thst
        he had worked for two-and-six a week
        in London, and that he didn't know
        why people laughed at him, and how
        he first walked his famous walk. The
        other things which we learned about
        Chaplin are probably known to every
        one who knows Charlie.</text>

	It' Grandmother's Recipe to
	Bring Back Color and
	Lustre to Hair.
	TffVbeautlfuJ, even ihnde of rlark,
	glossy Itair can only be had by brew
	ing a mixture of Sage Tea and Sul
	phur. Your batr is your charm. It
	makes or mars the face. When it
	fades, turns gray or streaked, just an
	application or two of Sage and Sul
	phur enhance ill appearance a hun
	dredfold. Don't bother to prepare the mix
	ture; you can get this famous old
	recine imnroved by the addition nf
	other ingredients at a small cost, all
	ready for use. It is called Wyrtlrs
	ige and Sulphur Compound. This
	can always be depended upon to bring
	back the natural color and lustre of
	your hair.
	Everybody uses "WyethV Sage nnd
	Sulphur Compound now because it
	darkens so naturally and evenly that
	nobody can tell it has been applied.
	You simply dampen a sponge or soft
	brush with it and draw this through
	the hair, taking one small strand at a
	time; by morning the gray hair has
	disappeared, and after another appli
	cation it becomes beautifully dark and
	appears glossy and lustrous. This
	ready-to-use preparation is a delightful

	Charlie Chaplin in a Care-Free, Gay S
	having Just the Way He Did Not,
	Says, So Far as She Was Conce
	NO recent case of broken romance and
	once fond hearts estranged has created
	such Interest as the suit for
	y divorce by Mrs. Charlie Chaplin against
	her husband, the world famous funny man
	of the motion pictures. The charges
	i brought by Mrs. Chaplin are "mental cruelty"
	and failure of her husband to provide
	for her. /
	Among the millions whom Charlie Chaplin
	has made laugh there l'"ve probably
	been msnv. wl'o hove thou?V*. how carefree
	and amusing the lot of the woman
	vas his wire. No wcma'.i, It would
	could ever have the toluss or be
	'ig but cheerful with so m.rthi~
	a companion. Yet strangely
	rre are no sadder, more posai'?
	than the professional humorni
	to use up all their store of

	"u. Charlie Chnnlln w.13 no exI?

	months in housekeeping expenses, although
	during that time Mrs. Chaplin herself
	was earning $1,000 a week.
	By Mr*. Charlie Chaplin
	(In an interview) <
	I AM quite ready to admit that my marriage
	to Charlie Chaplin was a mistake.
	It was a mistake on his part, because
	he is a genius, and geniuses should not
	I knarry. He would better be free and remain
	free, for he will make any 'woman he
	marries miserable, I know. J
	I We have been married for three years.
	Tor two of those years we lived under the1
	! same roof, more or less. That Is, if greeting
	a husband after long disappearances
	might be said to be living under t^e same
	L [roof with him.
	I If lying awake, weeping and wondering
	where your husband is, until 4 or 6 o'clock
	in the morning can really be called living.
	1 If wrangling over every bill that comes
	i in can be called Mving.
	If living on the scale of an income of
	$250 a week, when your husban<\ earns
	$13,000 a week, can be called living.
	If having your wardrobe censored and a
	standard of two or three dresses and one
	hat established may be considered an existence.
	If being told to Keep your head down
	to that no man will'see your face is living. .
	Tf hearing that meat and potatoes and
	i 'rtdlng are enough for a meal and that
	i ?? cream and salads are silly and useless
	iiMlv stands for proper living.
	V being constantly accused of flirting by
	n i'*n who Is causelessly Jealous Is living.
	*!', this and more I endured?and for
	; v? vn months. That Is the reason I hesit?te
	?o .'ay that we lived under the same
	, f. Tt wasn't living. It was perdition
	f- ?.
	U lias been said that a comedian Is only
	! i ,iy in public, I believe It. In fact, 1
	,< .W It. Chsrlle Chaplin, who has made
	ruil'lons laugh, only caused me tears.
	So It was better that we should separate,
	'letter that there be a divorce. 1 have
	KPsn htm since my suit for divorce began.
	We met in the office of my lawyer in L-os
	When we parted he said: "Mildred, you
	are right I should never have married.
	I know It now. Yon probably will marry
	soon. If rou do I hope you will be happy.
	I shall never marry again " And we
	looked at each other sadly?a funny man
	and his wife.
	That the public may not be misled by
	strange, false rumors I will tell for once
	nnrt finally, unless I tell It In court, the

	film specialty is tears, "sob stuff." And
	the news of the marriage 'was soon follow

	groom was not getting on very well with
	the tearful bride.
	Nobody seemed to know jti~t what was
	the matter but in due time Mrs. Chaplin
	admitted that she and her husband had
	separated. Then followed several state
	ments from Mrs. C'haplin but no comments
	came ifom Mr. Chaplin.
	At last the 'matrimonial troubles drifted
	into the Los Angeles courts. Mrs. (Chap

	A.-Well, when we %rere married Mr.
	Chaplin told me he wanted me to break
	the contract with the Pniversal, because
	he did not want me iorking with them.
	So, when I was in the hbspital, after I was
	first taken ill, I sent a written notice that
	I would not be with them any more and I
	was under age. My lawyer told me we
	could break the contract. Then, in Feb
	ruary. when I came back from Mt. Lowe.
	they had been sendjag me my check each
	-:eek, and I had been sending them back
	and they would return them again, but I
	had not cashed any. In February a friend
	of mine, Miss Bweet, asked me to go to
	New York with her when I came back
	from Mt. Lowe, and Mr. Chaplin had been
	away so long, and when he came back he
	said it would do me good to go to New
	York, so I wentt with her. But he wouldn't
	give me but $150.'and when I got East r
	bought a lot of baby clothes ad some baby
	furniture and a few other things, and I did
	not have enough money and I wired for
	more money. But he would not send me
	any more, so I wired mother to please
	ash one of my checks.
	Q.--That 'was the check that would re
	a-dirm your contract irith the Universal
	-eople, which he advised you to break?
	A-Yes, sir.
	Q.-Did you advise him with reference
	to your circumstances?
	A-Yes.
	Q.-DId you advise him that you expect
	ed to purchase some furniture for the ex
	pected child?
	A-Yes, sir.
	Q.-And he declined to send you any
	money at all?
	A.-Yes.
	Q.-And he was making apozimately
	16,000 or I7,000 a month at that time?
	A.-More than that.
	Q.-You mentioned the furniture. You
	say there was an arrangement made about
	snme turniture for the baby's room?
	A.-BDefore I went East Mr. Chaplin said
	Icould get a set of furniture for my room
	un in our home, because it was very dark.
	Q.-That was the room in which you
	were to be confined?
	A.-Yes, sir; my own roem. So. ?

	got back from he . York the room was all
	=urnished in thE aew furniture, ad he
	took me up to see it, and I was very happy
	about it aid he seemed to be quite pleased.
	but when the bfll came he refused to pay
	it. He said it was too expeasive and tat
	Ishould send it back.

	Famous Movie Comedian says
	London He Knew as Boy
	Does Not Exist Now
	BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN
	LONDON, Oct. 1. I always figure
	America under the symbol of youth
	vigorous, aggressive, full of hope and
	pen. courageous, and with the sun
	light of the morning shining in its
	eyes.
	I find England more like a serene
	old age mellowed by time, softened
	ly suffering, wise from long experi
	ence and with the. afterglow of the
	westering sun in its eyes.
	America, like all youth, has a core
	of hardness in its heart.
	England, like all mellowed old age
	has a core of tenderness in its heart.
	I should say America for work,
	England for thoughtful contempla
	tion and dreams. ,
	Of course, I know England is one of
	the mightiest nations in the world;
	that its hardy sons rule an empire;
	that they sail all seas and traffic In
	all markets. But I am merely trying
	to give my own impressions, to tell
	how the two countries 'affect me.
	I don't think I could do much work
	in England. Everything Is so finish
	ed, so settled, so restful that it would
	simply absorb' me.
	America Is Restless
	nut there Is in America a feeling of
	the unfinished, of restlessness that
	ius. makes one want to get up and do
	thjngs. That is why I am going back
	In a few weeks.
	It's all very nice to say that Chap
	lin brings laughter to men, but the
	truth is that Chaplin is working for
	his bread and cheese just like the
	rest of you. There is not much fun
	jn loafing too long.
	' I have been rediscovering England
	for myself aiyl contrasting my Im
	pressions of America and also with
	my memeories of the England I knew
	as a boy.
	' I came to America when I was 18
	und In the past 14 years have only
	been back home once. .
	My best experience has been to ram
	ble around the streets in the poor
	sections of London that I 'used
	know. I found in the mean streets
	something very lovely, something spir
	itunl. I nian as regards the people.
	There they were, living in misera
	ble ( tenements, their faces thin and
	pinehed from poor food, and yet there
	w something very beautiful in their
	eye.
	I. have never seen anything sweeter
	than the expression in the face of a
	girl out walking with her coster Tcrer.
	I began to understand how these
	poor people had suffered during the
	long years of the war and how thev
	had found the pluck to do it. and 1
	saw the mak rit had left on them. It
	was saddening as well as beautiful to
	get these -revelations.
	Had "Emotional Jag"
	Then I had an emotional jag. I
	prowled these poor streets in search
	or a wistful little bov I used to know
	a little, ill-dressed, rather fright
	ened Charlie Chaplin.
	Somehow. I couldn't quite catch up
	with him. The streets all seemed nar
	rower to me than they did to that
	little chap, and the crowds not quite
	so big and bustling, and the policemen
	not quite so terrifying.

	But I did see something we haven't
	got in America. eaw the mark Iof
	class distinction. The population In
	England Is really subdivided into real
	classes and castes. And being a very
	I old civilization and a very crowded
	country, it is hard for a man to get
	ou of his class.
	We have none of that in America.
	The workman of today still has the
	chance to be the captain of, industry
	of tomorrow. Why, the poor editor of
	yesterday is the president of today!
	America" is still in thd construction
	stage. She is not finished. That i
	why the builders, who are at work on
	the structure today, should be so very
	careful.
	It seems to me, looking back
	across the waters and across time,
	that America Is in a very critical pe
	riod. 1
	Finance is once, more in danger of
	falling into the 1 bands of the few we
	always call "Wall Street."
	And finance is adapting a taa Intol
	erant attitude toward labor. Labor
	should not be -asked to do all the giv
	ing un. Finance should give up a lit
	tle, also."
	There is a danger that if there is
	too much clash, a class feeling will
	develon which would be entirely un
	American. Too Much Organization
	I think "another danger to America
	is the number 'of organizations which
	are growing up which are anti-some-bodyq,
	anti-some religion or race or
	creed or free expression of thought.
	America can learn a lesson in this
	regard from old England. There is
	far greater personal liberty and far
	greater iibertv of speech in England
	than in America. .
	Since havle been over here I have
	seen it stated that I am a deep reader
	and that I am a Socialist. I would
	like to deny both statements. I am
	not a highbrow. I don't pretend to
	be. My only pretension is to be an
	rtist. I don't mix in, politics. And
	I am nol immersed in economic litera
	tu. " . " .. i
	I am neither, a Socialist 'nor a par
	lor Bolshevik. But I believe with all
	mv heart in social reform. I believe
	very strongly in municipal ownership
	of public utilities. I believe in the
	nationalization of the railways and
	probably of coai mines. ,

	i .5 there is this hidden scamp hero with
	whom Chaplin identifies himself and
	with whom the world of respectabilities
	??nd conventionalities is in conflict.
	Chaplin expresses for us an imaginary

	it by resolving it into a joke.

	bowl this secret and reveals it in
	Iiiis hook.
	Gar!...' Chaplin's book is from the
	psychological angle a remarkable hu?
	man document, greatly because of this
	revelation. It explains the appeal of
	this poor little feeble creature on the
	outglde of the great big world. To the
	reade?r unversed in psychology the
	outstanding features of the book are
	likely to be the triumphant return of
	Charlie Chaplin to the land of his birth
	his meetings with the great in poli?
	tics and letters his sympathy for the
	unfortunate his intimate confessions
	of his likes and dislikes. However, the
	real revelation lies in Charlie's visits
	to the haunts of his childhood.
	Trio whole tone of the book is that
	of a half lonely ?'dventurer visiting the
	scene:; of his early 1 i fr. reacting with
	genuine sympathy to every situation.
	We learn of Chaplin's early experi?
	ence as a little ragged urchin. On top
	of that, experience has been imposed
	this magical thing- for his succ?s?? has
	been like an Arabian Nights fantasy?
	and 1 doubt if he has ever quite real?
	ized tha' ?t vvas he who has had it.
	This little ragged urchin has stayed
	v.ith Chaplin all his life and is the
	main reason for his tremendous hu?
	man appeal.
	? ? ?
	OUR or five years ago ?ome neigh?
	bor child came rushing to me, all
	out of breath. She was all excited, for
	she was going to the Hippodrome to see
	"Charlie Chaplin himself.'' ?
	At thar time "Charlie Chaplin him-'
	self didn't mean any more to me than !
	Charlie in the, movies. But after read?
	ing his book T feel that I do know
	Charlie Chaplin himself. In another
	age. where he would have had to ap
	pear directly in person before his
	audiences, the chances are that the
	personal side of his art would have
	been more evident to the people, who
	are rather inclined to look down on
	the movies, anyhow, and who have re?
	garded Charlie Chaplin merely as a
	comedian who makes lots of money.
	The motion picture ,is a medium of
	expression is a syndicate sort of thing.
	It takes a tremendous amount of per?
	sonality to overcame the?" difficulties.
	] !. ? crowds who have bce'n rooting for
	Chaplin have been psychologically cor?
	rect. 'While he has an enormous popu?
	larity, he doesn't make an appeal to
	the crowd mind, but rather a secret

	What was Chaplin like?
	remember that I paid a large tax
	on my own income. In 1917, for
	instance, it was about 50 per cent.
	Some of the stars were per
	sonally just as fabulous charac
	ters as the fan magazines painted
	them. I was married to one
	Doughs Fairbanks. You could
	almost say that he went through
	life swinging from chandelier to
	chandelier, just as he did in his
	pictures. He wasn’t a show-off
	just naturally a joyous person.
	During our honeymoon abroad,
	we had dinner one night at the
	"Tour d’Argent” in Paris. Like
	every other guest there, I mar
	veled at the great view of Notre
	Dame Cathedral, and Doughs
	seemed impressed, too. He said,
	"You know, Mary. I think I can
	see enough hand-holds to climb
	all the way up that right-hand
	tower.”
	Daredevils Fairbanks and Ford
	One time in California Doughs
	and I visited Henry Ford’s home.
	I was awed by the dour old
	billionaire, but not Doughs. He
	jollied Mr. Ford outrageously and
	the two went out for a stroll
	on the estate. I stayed in the
	drawing room with Mrs. Ford,
	and when it came time to go, I
	went outside to find Doughs. He
	was sitting astride the ridgepole
	of the house, three stories up,
	and Henry Ford was sitting there
	with him, laughing fit to kill.
	When I got Doughs alone, 1
	really lit into him.
	"Perfectly safe,” he protested.
	"I tried the hand-holds twice
	before I let him go up.”
	It certainly was an era of fabu
	lous nonsense! But at least it was
	fun and it was harmless. The fans
	saw to that! A breath of scandal
	that touched a star could ruin
	~jjtSk<RU*r
	him. The standards were so strict
	that they were sometimes grossly .
	unfair: When a famous director,
	William Desmond Taylor was
	mysteriously murdered, Mabel
	Normand’s career was blighted,
	though she had no connection
	with the murder at all she had
	merely been going out with
	Taylor.
	The truth about Charlie
	I mentioned that many of the
	Hollywood stars of yesterday were
	characters born almost of fan
	tasy. But of course many weren’t,
	and surprisingly enough, Charlie
	Chaplin was one of the latter. The
	one question that people ask more
	than any other is: "What was
	Charlie Chaplin like?” The an
	swer: "When Charlie wasn’t act
	ing, he tended to be a bore.”
	Charlie was the star of any
	party as long as he was doing his
	parlor "bits.” But whenever he
	wasn’t performing, he could be
	very tiresome. He was forever
	launching into long lectures on
	dry subjects. One of his obses
	sions was the British monetary
	system and how he proposed to
	reform it.
	But regardless of how one may
	feel about Charlie Chaplin as a
	person, nobody furthered the
	story-book tradition more than he
	did. Wis old silent movies were
	nuuterpierei of make-believe,
	ereryoneoj thorn worth • dozen
	modem triumph* of realism.
	I'm not suggesting that realism
	isn’t good. But I do suggest very
	strongly that if we Americans and
	our entertainment keep on get
	ting any more sophisticated and
	hard-bitten, we might someday
	lose one of the greatest of all
	human arts: the art of believing
	in make-believe. The M

	Says:
	“And the enormous crowds left the theatre with every emotion, from hysterical
	gales of laughter to the stifled sobs of sympathy, completely exhausted.
	“That was the experience of the audience at the New York Strand theatre last night
	who went to the opening of Charlie Chaplin’s new film, ‘The Kid,’ First National’s six
	reels of joy. ‘Six reels of joy’ tells but half of it, for while the comedian has never
	been so mirth-provoking in any previous production, the story which is unfolded con
	tains more real heart-throbs than many a picture that has built up reputations for
	emotional actresses.
	“Charlie is himself, but he has injected himself into a story of heart interest that has
	seldom been equaled. The synopsis of it sounds rather trite, for it starts'with the
	abandonment of her baby by the woman who has been wronged. Charlie finds the
	baby and raises him to boyhood. The typical Chaplinesque methods of raising the
	Kid are responsible lor a good part of the humor with which the piece abounds,
	while his pitiable, whimsical procedure to gain the child’s love dampened many an
	eye. The dramatic climax of the film comes with Chaplin’s losing fight, and the
	Kid’s despair when the law separates them, but this is followed so closely by a bit
	of comedy which, perhaps, is the best of the piece, in which Charlie rescues him
	after a chase over roof tops, that people laugh the lumps right out of their throats.
	“If you love comedy you cannot afford to miss seeing “The Kid,” and if you enjoy
	being held enthralled in the grip of pathos, there is a treat awaiting after you go
	into the theatre where it is showing.”
	The daylight trials of motherhood, and the midnight
	trials of paternity are all for Chaplin in this super
	comedy. He is a good mother to the Kid, and when
	that Kid grows up he surely becomes a good son,
	for Charlie is a wondering glazier, and while the Kid
	goes ahead breaking windows, Charlie is always at
	hand to get the job of mending them. And yet there
	is a sob now and then; you never expected that of
	Charlie, did you.
	If You Love Comedy You Cannot Afford to Miss It.
	If you enjoy being held enthralled in the grip of pathos a treat awaits you</text>

	Cried Pola Negri in Tragic Earnestness.
	SCARCELY two years since Charlie Chaplin
	was divorced from Mildred Harris, is
	wife, and now his new romance wi
	German-Pole film star, Pola Negri, is clou e
	with trouble.
	The Polish nobleman, Count Dombski, has
	heard the news where he happens now to be in
	England and has announced that Pola Negri is
	still his wife and that Charlie Chaplin must face
	him in a duel if he dares to marry Pola Negri.
	It would be a strange sight if the motion
	picture audiences could see the fiery Count
	Dombski rush forward, sword in hand, to make
	the great film comedian answer to him on the
	field of honor. But the threatened duel is hardly
	likely to happen where the movie cameras can photograph it.
	x Charlie Chaplin is very handy with that cane of his. Is it
	possible that Mr. Chaplin would take a humorous view of the
	wild-eyed Polish Count and would give him a lesson in fencing
	with his cane? z ~
	The film audiences have seen Mr. Chaplin wiggle away from
	all sorts of threatening situations and,-again and again, that
	handy cane has tripped up policemen and detectives and big
	bullies. But that was on the screen. What would Charlie do
	rn a real life encounter with Count Dombski and his sharp-edged
	S "°ln the recent news from the interesting lovers Pola Negri
	has sebmed to be rather more demonstrative than Mr. Chaplin.
	The expressions that have come from the comedian have seemed
	to be rather conservative, as if, perhaps, he had some anxieties
	or misgivings in the back of his nead. Has Charlie Chaplin re
	ceived a warning that he will be held to account on the field of
	honor if he takes Pola Negri as a bride?
	Pola Negri is a very attractive woman, and it is not surpris
	ing that a man who was lucky enough to once possess her would
	fight valiantly not to lose her. Very little has been revealed as
	to the exact facts of Pola Negri’s marriage to Count Dombski, or
	just when, where, and under what circumstances the divorce
	was secured which Pola Negri relies upon to make it possible
	for her to marry Charlie Chaplin.
	But the interview quoted above with Count, Dombski was
	secured by a British newspaper, and if Count Dombski makeg
	good his threat to come to America and require an accounting
	at the hands of Charlie Chaplin, a very interesting situation
	will develop.
	Whether Count Dombski is now cn his way to America to
	settle things with the film comedian and his runaway wife has
	not been announced. It is possible that Count Dombski may
	be arranging his affairs in a leisurely manner and may not
	arrive until after the marriage takes place.
	Whatever Count Dombski may be planning to do, there is

	little doubt that the Polish nobleman is a man of vigorous per
	sonality and violent manner. He is an excellent swordsman and
	a very good shot with the pistol.
	Pola Negri herself, in telling of her romance and carriage
	to Count Dombski, explains that he was so violently opposed to
	having his wife continue working in the studios that he forbade
	her to go on with her contracts with the Berlin movie producers.
	“The parting of the ways came one night a few months
	.after we were married,” she said, “when I was making one of
	my periodic stays at Count Dombski’s castle at Sassnowiece, in
	Poland. A telegram arrived about midnight, calling me back to
	the Berlin studio, and when I showed it to my husband he flew
	into a violent rage.
	“Drawing his revolver, he told me that if I left for Berlin
	it would be over his dead body. Knowing how he felt about the
	matter, I recalled that the climax had been reached and that he
	might do something desperate. So I told him 1 would remain.
	“But that night, after he had gone to sleep, I got up and
	dressed and, taking only such clothes as I could carry in my
	arms, I left the castle, never to return.
	“How I reached the railway station at Sassnowiece after my
	escape is still a mystery to me. I must have walked and run
	miles in the darkness. But my mind was made up—my career
	came first, cost what it may. And, as luck would have it, there
	was a train for Berlin almost ready to depart when I arrived
	at the station —the spot where our romance had begun nearly
	a year before.” ...
	The lady who says she is no longer Countess Dombski, and is
	eager to be Mrs. Charles Chaplin, is most emphatic on the
	points at issue between her and the Count. “I deny that I
	am the wife of the Count, and I challenge him to try to assert
	his supposed rights in any court in the world. I have the
	proper decree dissolving the marriage,” she insists.
	“I am told that it is in proper form in all respects, and
	that there is nothing to bind me to the Count. I am as free
	as ever I,was, and he cannot stop me marrying the man of
	Great Britain Bights Uesrrved.

	of my choice.
	“Charlie and I love each other. We are made for eatfl
	other, and we intend to seek happiness together < until death '
	alone parts us. .Charlie sought me out among the artists of tho
	world, and helped me to achieve greater fame than 1 enjoyed
	up to then. We found that we were not only soul mates, but
	that we had the temperament in our art that made tho one
	Tthe complement of the other, and we both think that In associa
	tion we can achieve our greatest and best work.”
	At Los Angeles she appears everywhere Charlie is to bo
	seen, and goes around with the triumphant air of the woman
	in possession who will not surrender her rights to the film
	artist under any circumstances.
	“There is no law that can keep us apart,” she says. “Wo
	are masters of. our own fate, and we shall not be prevented
	from uniting our lives by ahy one. I love only Charlie in tho
	world. He is my ting among men, and I will marry him in
	spite of everything and everybody who tries to come between
	us all.”
	Mr. Chaplin is less defiant, and at times has the appearance
	of being uncomfortable under the aggressive manner in which
	he is claimed as her- affinity by the lady who seems to have
	discovered in him the perfect lover immediately after he found
	in her the perfect film star.
	Mlle. Pola Negri, when questioned regarding the suggestion
	that she as a Roman Catholic could hardly claim the right to
	remarry after divorce, replied rather vaguely:
	“On that there is a good deal of misunderstanding. I can
	only tell you that I have taken the best -advice from legal and
	spiritual advisers, and there is no real barrier to our marriage
	if we decide to go through with it. •
	“Fate brought Charlie and' me into contact, and we should
	be foolish to run pway from our happiness decreed by fate.
	He was on his way back to America when he was shown a
	film in which I appeared.
	“He said to,the person who showed the film, ‘Why, this is
	the artiste I have been looking for since I first went into the
	film business.’ I received a telegram soon after asking if I
	would meet him.
	“I did not know him except by name, and I did not think
	I should like him, so I said ‘No.’ But in spite of that he came
	and I realized at once that he was altogether different to what
	I had expected, for not only was he a great actor but he was
	a real man in every sense of the word.
	“I found myself won over by his charming manners, and I
	felt that I had at last found the man to whose keeping I could
	surrender, my heart, my life, and my future happiness without
	hesitation. Working with him makes a great deal of difference
	to me.
	“I feel that I can give a better expression to my heart
	under his eyes, and for his sake I try to surpass anything I
	have ever done before. I used to think that Charlie was fust
	what you call a clown, with no art and no message, but now I
	know that behind his clowning there is a real art and a real
	message, if only those who see nis films would understand them.
	“Charlie seeks to portray the- life of ‘Les of
	the great cities and to arouse the comfortable classes to their
	duties and responsibilities to the less fortunate.”
	The story of the beginning of the Chaplin-Negri romance
	is very interesting.
	Charlie was shown some, of the films of the lady in London
	and again in Paris. He liked them so well that he must needs
	rush to Berlin and then to Vienna to see the artiste for himself.
	“A veritable queen of the movies, the most perfect acting
	features I ever seen, capable of expressing every con
	ceivable shade of emotion with the skill and grace of the true
	artiste,” he exclaimed.
	These were among the eulogies passed by Charlie on the
	lady as an artiste, but later he had something to say of her as
	a worn in, as a beauty, and as a charmer of hearts. * She has
	all the qualities of form and soul that fit a woman to reign
	over the heart of a man and to be his greatest inspiration in
	whatever he regards as his life work,” he declared. I
	And Pola Negri was no less lavish in what She said of
	Charlie. “A man that any woman could love, could work with
	as life partner, and feel honored in doing so, finding her true
	happiness in association with his life.,” she declared.
	“He has the true soul of an artiste and is an ideal lover
	with the capacity for making even the most capricious woman
	happy,” were among the things she said of him, and after
	this semi-public love-making, it was only to be expected that
	the rapturous crowds of admirers should be eager to lead the
	happy pair to the altar in order that their lives might be united
	for better or for worse. . . . ,
	Will Count Dombski cool off and let things take their course
	or will he turn up in America and ask Charlie Chaplin to meet
	him on the field of honor? And then what?</text>

	His twenty-eighth home run for tho season cleared the top of the right field
	grandstand, the longest hit that was ever seen since the days when the

	<text>Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin
	ipai slugger in major league baseball these day?, has recently given
	ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
	e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
	ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
	;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
	ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
	?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
	ra club unless his wishes are granted.
	. Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
	alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
	?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
	oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
	Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
	e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
	Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
	'?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
	?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.
	The Joke of the sltuatioa is that

	Manhattan Tribe Purchase Home Run Slug

	In History of Baseball.
	Boston, Jan. 5.?"Babe" Ruth, world champion home-run player
	of the Red Sox, has been bought by the New York Yankees, ac
	cording to an announcement made tonight. Harry H. Frazee, owner
	of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
	price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
	The deal was said to have involved no other players.
	Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon "inside
	information," placed the figure at which "Babe" Ruth was told at
	,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
	substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
	figure was not far from correct.
	Highest Figure Yet Paid.
	If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
	vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
	sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
	a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
	a player.
	When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to
	Chicago, $55,000 changed hands. The greatest price paid for a single
	player up to the trading of Ruth was said to have been the $50,000
	given for Tris Speaker when he went from the Red Sox to Cleveland.</text>

	All these tilings doubtless have some

	thl:- iii.<yionn'nal series of home runs sci
	i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to
	his work with the bat certain well-known
	principles of physics and psychology.
	"But." you say. "Iluth Is a ball plavor.
	What does ho know of physics or psy
	chology?"
	Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
	sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies
	certain well-known principles of these two
	sciences every time ho makes a homo run.
	Let us consider some of the many inter
	rsting scientific factors involved in bat
	t itig a ball.
	As < very follower of baseball knows, a
	home run is the knocking of the ball out
	of the reaoli of opposing players and in
	.r.uch a direction and to nuch a distance as
	<o make its return impossil'o before th?
	runner completes the circuit of the bases.
	Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit
	ting of a home run moans simply hitting
	t)i< ball with the bat so as to give it great
	speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
	and direction which the bat can To made to
	give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
	curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
	the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
	of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
	bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
	pinges on the bat.
	The speed which a ball t * es on im
	mediately after its collision w'th the bat
	is a little difficult to compete because
	neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
	elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
	trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
	let mo explain what happens when per
	fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
	bodies come into collision.
	If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
	of lead?of equal weight and going with
	equal speed, but in opposite directions
	meet squarely "in mid-air, they will both
	stop and fall to the ground, all theii
	energy of motion having been turned into
	heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
	of the same weight going with the same
	velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
	in mid-air, they will bounce back with
	the same velocity they had originally. 11
	one of these bodies has twice the velocity
	of the other, the latter will bounce back
	with twice its original velocity and tho
	former will bounce back only half as fast.
	All this applies to bodies having tho same
	weight. Whenever one of the colliding
	bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
	locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
	is enormously increased.
	The bat which "Rabe" Ruth wields and
	the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
	tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
	the ball will be driven farther the heavier
	the bat and the faster the bat is moving
	as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
	"Halm" Ruth's body prevents his bat from
	doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
	ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
	hits it.
	The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
	important factor in hitting a homo run,
	viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

	were no atmosphere, everytliine be
	ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
	ho the farther it would go. The friction of
	the air. however, slows the ball up con
	siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
	into consideration with several others.
	The conclusion which science reaches Is
	that the heavier tho ball is, without In
	creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
	ticity, tho farther it will go after being
	struck with tho bat.
	The direction taken by a batted ball is
	affected to some extent by the rotation of
	tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
	is of the neatest importance when the
	but does not strike tho ball squarely.
	It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
	in such a way that it actually increases the
	latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
	fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
	ball in such a way that it takes on a de
	cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
	knows what a common occurrence this is
	on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
	dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
	weirdest imaginable path through the air,
	particularly if it passes through various
	air currents.
	A honr n depends to a very large ex
	tent up> ? direction given the batted
	ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
	he estimated a- nine times that of tho
	speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
	we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
	also the vertical angle at which tho ball
	leaves the hat. For example, no matter
	how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
	sult in a home run unit's ."t clears the
	upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
	field.
	It is plain that the direction given
	the butted ball must depend to a largo
	extent upon the manner in which the ball
	is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
	vided the ball is given a proper rota
	tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
	the kind of curve best suited to make it
	difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
	angle is either tho down shoot or the up
	shoot. On account of the many variablo
	factors concerned science believes that any
	home run made with either of theso curve3
	is a lucky chance pure and simple.
	After the ball has boon set in motion by
	the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
	it will go depends upon the vertical angle
	at which it starts. The most desirable
	angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
	or about half a right angle. Other factors
	which determine the distance a batted ball
	will travel are the speed of the ball, its
	sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
	and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
	speed of the ball tho more perfectly
	spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
	and the less rotation with which it travels
	the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
	ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
	A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
	free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
	it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
	its progress.
	If science wore asked to make it difficult
	or well-nigh impossible for "Babe" Kutli to
	Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
	tho barometer was high, with the air so
	heavy with moisture that it would retard
	the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
	pitcher selected would be one good on very
	alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
	pitcher were not available, one who hid
	euch great speed that lie couid put any
	kind of a ball over the plato for tho
	batter would bo chosen. With this
	hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
	be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
	started on its course at the proper angle.
	His hitting of a homo run could then bo
	mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
	redoubtable "Babe" to use a bat either so
	heavy that he could not swing it with much
	speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
	tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
	There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
	ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
	ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
	knows as the centre of percussion. If the
	ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
	greatest effect is produced. All ball play
	ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
	on the bat, not only through the absence
	of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
	iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
	but which is no doubt physical as well as
	mentnl.
	"Babe" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec
	ord is largely due to tho fact that, con
	sciously or unconsciously, he has found a
	way of producing the collision between
	his bat and tho ball on this centre of per
	cussion more frequently than any other
	player.
	What is called the centre of percussion
	is a principle that enters into the design
	not only ot baseball bats, but of all things
	designed for men to swing. In the ham
	mer, for example, the centre of percussion
	should be in the head. If the tool is not
	designed so that this centre is properly
	located the hammer is unsatisfactory to
	use because it jars and tires tho am too
	much.
	The problem of hitting homo runs with
	the surprising frequency that "Babe" Ruth
	does is ono more complicated in the mat
	ter of powers of Judgment and observa
	tion involved than in mechanical prin
	ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem,
	tho home run requires a bat just as heavy
	as a player can use with comfort, tho bat
	to bo given a motion as fast as possible
	when hitting the ball, and striking the
	ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho
	air at an anglo of approximately 42 de
	grees or half a right angle. The ball
	should also, of course, be hit at such a
	horizontal angle as not to cause a foul.
	T^lio weight of the batter has very little
	to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his
	arm muscles are a controlling factor to
	the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course,
	If his arms are rigid enough to make tho
	bat for all practical purposes a part of his
	body when he hits the ball, and if his body
	is swung forward at just that instant, it
	Is possible that a heavy batter, all other
	things being equal, would be able to knock
	the ball farther than a lighter player.

	To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's
	hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is
	often travelling at the rate of lf>0 feet
	a second, or nearly two milos a minuto.
	The eye movement necessary to follow it
	increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor
	and nearer the plato, owing to tho in
	crease in the angle of vision which, by the
	time the ball is over tho plate, is about
	ten times what it was when it left tho
	pitcher's hand.
	As 1 have said, tho pitcher often hurls
	the ball at the rato of 150 feet a second.
	But tho ball is travelling much faster
	than that when it leaves "Babe" Ruth's bat
	after being hit for one of tho home runs
	that have made him famous. This is in
	accordance with the laws of tho impact of

	farther it will bounce

	Of courso, If it Is raining
	when one of "Babe" Ruth's
	long hits is made, the
	drops of water striking tho
	ball will bring it to the
	ground long before it
	otherwise would fall. Tho
	rain also makes the ball
	heavier, and as It contains
	only so much energy to
	k start with, it will bo
	\ slowed up in its flight on
	account of some of tho
	L?rIL.? energy being used to give

	flow much actual energy does "Babe"
	Ruth expend in hitting one of his home
	fns? Tho activity or horsepower involved
	1* very great, but it is in operation only
	for tho" fraction of a second.
	The ball which "liabe" Ruth hits for a
	V e run weighs about tivo ounces. If
	n % at gives it a velocity of 500 feet a see
	on.., wo find, by applying a well known
	formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds
	of actual energy or work is done. Now,
	if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second
	to impart this energy by a swing of his bat,
	this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot
	pounds a second, which is about forty-four
	horsepower.
	Tho king of homo run makors Is then
	working at tho rate of forty-four horse
	power evory time ho cracks out one of hla
	long hits, but he maintains this rate for
	such a brief length of time i.hat not very
	much actual work is involved.

	up to (lato coulil ho collected into a singlo

	Twenty-nine such runs last season and

	this would he the equivalent of more than
	2,000-horsepower?enough if exerted bo
	hind a gigantic bat to demolish a building
	like Now York's Metropolitan Tower!
	Of course, there are many psychological
	as well as mechanical factors involved in
	the hitting of tho long scries of home runs
	which "Babe" Ruth has been making for
	two seasons. The batter must bo able to
	"sense" in some manner not yet fully un
	derstood just about what kind of ball the
	pitcher is going to throw. Then he must bo
	capable of putting his body in readiness
	with lightning swiftness to meet that kind
	of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho
	player's Judgment about tho bull must bo
	made within tho smallest fraction of a sec
	ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand.
	Through some queer sixth sense?tne
	kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it
	?all batters have tho feeling as to whether
	the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go
	ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho
	average batter the impressions conveyed
	by this sixth sense caunot be more than (50
	per cent accurate, but in the case of "Babe"
	Ruth, as his batting record shows, they
	must be about 90 per cent accurate. As
	everybody who plays baseball or ever
	watches a game knows, you can't strike out
	and make a homo run. and the player can
	seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha
	strikes is taking a course that would havo
	carried it straight across the plate unless
	Interrupted by his bat.
	This, then, is the secret of "Babe"
	Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien
	tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin
	aesthetic sense enables him to "sense" the
	kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw.
	When a ball rotating on Its horizontal
	n.\is and curving most favorably for his
	purpose comes along he swings his bat at
	it with an energy sufficient to chango its
	direction and greatly increase its velocity.

	"Did Babe Ruth Get Another One To-day?"
	| Not "How Did the Game Come Out?"
	*| Now the Great American Question 4
	<
	By W? O. McGeehan
	IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
	peare were a' baseball writer he
	might usa a line that he
	wested upon some more or less
	obscure hero of antiquity and say of
	"Babe" Ruth, "He doth bestride the
	narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
	sus." For "Babe" Ruth is Hercules
	and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
	of Swat. His bat is the club of
	Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
	the symbol of sheer, primitive might
	before which the puny folk bow and
	offer worship.
	But for the game of baseball, the
	youngest game of the youngest peo?
	ple, George Herman Ruth, the
	"Babe" Ruth who dwarfs all other
	personalities in the daily news,
	might have been a peaceful cigar
	maker or perhaps a third-rate
	heavyweight pugilist instead of the
	national idol of the American people.
	The "Babe" was Fortune's dar?
	ling, though Fortune concealed her
	great and kindly intentions as far as
	he was concerned when the "Babe"
	was 2. boy. For the "Babe" was
	born left-hander!. Hercules was a
	right-hander. Thor never was pic?
	tured as wielding his hammer from
	the port side. None of the heroes of
	antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
	tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
	Wilson was the first novelist to put a
	left-hander in the near-hero class,
	and he <i;d it in a half-hearted
	fashion.
	Moreover, little George Herman
	Ruth was a half-orphan at a very
	early age and was sent to an insti?
	tution for orphans. He was nearly
	an orphan boy, and, according to
	the San ford and Merton books, he
	should have taken a morbid sort of
	point of view at an early age and
	learned something useful. But the
	youth of "Babe" Ruth was applied
	mostly to the study of the great
	American game of baseball.
	You are not going to draw any
	conventional moral from the early
	boyhood of "Babe" Ruth. He was
	not a particularly industrious or
	thrifty lad, chockful of conventional
	virtues. He was just a normal,
	chuckle-headed combination of Tom
	Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He
	Was Just natural and just human.
	FORTUNATELY the boyhood of
	"Babe" Ruth was intrusted to
	men who understand human
	nature, and particularly the human
	boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal?
	timore. The fraternity is not limited
	to Baltimore. It is all over the
	*orld. It is made up of big-hearted
	?fcn. consecrated to the work of mak
	lfig men out of the raw material.
	They had charge of the bringing
	UP of George Herman Ruth and
	'hey have turned over to the world
	??Colossus of Swat. It is due to
	th*ir human understanding that
	George Herman Ruth was not
	wwarted and turned aside into more
	Wo**ic iine8 0f encjeavor,
	U?Kt lana&tiQ than ?sqr *rf fbe
	I boy romances of Tattered Tom and
	Ragged Dick, by Horatio Alger jr.
	; is the rise of "Babe" Ruth. The Al-,
	| ger heroes became mere bankers or
	traction magnates, but George Her
	| man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be?
	came "Babe" Ruth, at whose shrine
	' bankers and traction magnates burn
	incense. Ever and anon these jaded
	near-successes pick up the tape, not
	to see the condition of the market,
	but to learn whether the latest is the
	forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run
	! knocked out by the "Babe" for the
	I season.
	And these heroes envy "Babe"
	! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who
	! was regarded as far from bright in
	;his classes. For the "Babe" can hit
	them out with the joyous freedom of
	Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor
	throwing his hammer through the'
	clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers
	are vain when he faces them, and all
	the walls of the baseball parks are
	lowered when his bat crashes against
	the baseball. Homer would have
	loved him if the blind singer had had
	a season pass to the Polo Grounds.
	THAT Ruth is the greatest bat?
	ter of them all is admitted by
	two members of the old Orioles;
	and when two members of the old
	Orioles agree upon anything, that
	makes it official and irrefutable. If
	there is anybody so ignorant of im?
	portant American history that he
	does not know who the old Orioles
	are, we will explain, more in pity
	than in indignation, that the old
	Orioles were members of the great?
	est baseball team of a generation or
	so ago.
	The two Orioles who made the ad?
	mission that "Babe" Ruth was the
	greatest baseball player in the whole
	world are Wilbert Robinson, mana?
	ger of the Brooklyn National League
	baseball team, and Joseph Kelly,
	scout for the Yankees. Both of these
	gentlemen are grandfathers and citi?
	zens of high repute in the city where
	they dwell, which also happens to i
	be the home of "Babe" Ruth. "Wil-1
	bert Robinson was a catcher, and still
	; holds the world's record for consecu?
	tive base hits in one game. Joseph
	Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on
	the old Orioles, and his present oc-1
	cupation is "ivory hunting," looking
	upon baseball playera and appraising
	them ?at their true > jrtb to their
	employers and to the national pas?
	time.
	These two authorities admitted" to
	me in th? presence of witnesses that
	never, even in the days of the old
	Orioles, was there a baseball player
	who could hit like "Babe" Ruth. Con?
	sider the importance of this admis?
	sion. The members of the old Ori?
	oles are the most conservative per?
	sons in th vorld. Never before
	have they au. : ..ed that any player
	of the present was anywhere near as
	wonderful as tl\e players of their
	glorious day.
	"He can hit them harder than any?
	body, and he can hit them oftener,"
	they admitted from the fullness of
	their hearts. They did not qualify
	the statement, They did ?ob assert
	that the pitchers were less canny
	and that the ball parks were smaller.
	They admitted that the heroes of
	their day were lost in the shadow of
	the Colossus of Swat. They admitted
	that even in the days when the old
	Orioles were young "Babe" Ruth
	would have loomed up above them
	all.
	That Ruth broke all big league
	records for home run getting last
	year is in the book. That he has
	broken his own record this year and
	is on the way to setting a mark far
	beyond the misty horizons ?if the
	baseball world is l?o\vn. But the
	old Orioles have explained away the
	performances of other more modern
	heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve?
	ments they Jr&ott ungrudgingly.,
	That is almost as marvelous as the
	achievements themselves.
	.
	ONCE upon a time the youth of
	this land worshiped another
	young giant, a right-hander
	and an exponent of another and el?
	der sport?John L. Sullivan. The
	right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was
	mighty in its day, but the left arm i
	of "Babe" Ruth is mightier in its I
	day and generation in the matter of
	sheer numbers of worshipers.
	| They used to block the corridors
	of the hotels, and even the streets,1
	? to see the mighty John L. pass. They
	do that in the case of "Babe" Ruth,
	I too. It is not for me to disparage
	| the memory of John L. Sullivan, the
	| gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest
	-?
	ring glory, but I think, that his ad?
	mirers saw that particular John L.
	through rose glasses and that they
	worshiped an illusion.
	The John L. Sullivan of the later !
	day, the John L. who beat down his ?
	own worst enemy and lifted up his ;
	self-respect from the muck, was the
	John L. that should have been wor- ;
	shiped, for that John L. Sullivan :
	was a mighty gladiator. The John ,
	L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j
	tagonists with a right-hand punch to j
	the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ?
	and muscle, but the gray and fat old |
	John L. who conquered himself was i
	the true fighter.
	But we are considering the John L.
	that was the popular idol, the '
	brawny man who was followed by '
	the men and the boys and cheered
	when he stalked abroad. He was !
	not a particularly affable character.
	This big "Babe" Ruth is a far
	more likable person. He is full of i
	good nature and the joy of living.
	He is a modest enough young man, :
	and he knows his limitations, though ;
	he acknowledges no limitations as j
	far as the baseball diamonds and j
	the fences around them are con
	cerned. He is not falsely modest to
	the point of affectation, for he has
	that supreme confidence in himself
	that comes after certain achievement.
	But he will not play to the gallery
	consciously. He likes the gallery
	and he understands it, and he likes
	to have it understand him. ?
	Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or
	it may be too wise, to try to fool his
	gallery, as other stars of his own ;
	game or stars in other lines of en?
	deavor have tried to do in vain. For
	nobody can fool his gallery. No
	truly wise man ever tried.
	THE best judges of a man ar?
	the men with whom he works !
	or with whom he plays.
	"Babe" Ruth, naturally, is the high?
	est salaried ballplayer on the New
	York Yankees. He might, if he were
	like some of the stars of baseball or i
	stars of some of the arts, claim all
	the privileges of a star and hold
	himself aloof from his fellow players.
	Here again is the simplicity or the
	wisdom of "Babe" Ruth. He plays
	the game with the team and for the
	team, and the men ' he plays with
	know it and appreciate it. "Babe'
	Ruth will even make the "college
	try" to get a base on an impossible
	chance. The "cdllege try" is the vet?
	eran professional's term of contempt
	for zealous endeavor that seems fu?
	tile on the facts of it.
	_ an the "Babe" *nake?th? two
	owners of the Yankees, Colonels I
	Ruppert and Huston, shudder with !
	apprehension when he hurls himself
	against a wall to get a fly ball, or I
	when he throws his huge bulk
	through the air in the effort to steal i
	a base. They rejoice in his spirit
	and his wholehearted way of play?
	ing, but at the same time they per?
	spire with apprehension lest some?
	thing should happen that would de?
	prive them of the most expensive in?
	vestment in professional baseball.
	Some stars have disrupted base?
	ball teams, rousing jealousies, but
	"Babe" Ruth, admittedly the great?
	est star of them all, has made the
	Yankees a team. The advent of the
	"Babe" has brought them the chance
	of that "world's scries dough," which
	should be something like $7,000 a
	player. It has also made them the
	team of the big leagues. They do not
	begrudge the "Babe" the homage
	that is paid him. As far as Ruth
	is concerned, there is no professional
	jealousy on the Yankee team.
	Just to what extent the present
	prosperity of professional baseball
	is due to "Babe" Ruth I would not
	care to say, but it is considerable
	When I first trailed West with tht
	Yankees, they told me in Chicagc
	that there had been little or no in
	tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu
	I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi
	they turned out to the extent of 20,
	000 a day and upward to see the
	"Babe" "bust one."
	Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the
	eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen,
	the Chicago pitcher passed "Babe"
	Ruth. Ten thousand people started
	to walk out of Comiskey Park.
	There remained yet the chance of
	the melodramatic ninth inning rally,
	but the ten thousand had lost all
	interest in the game for the after?
	noon. It was clear thatr they were
	not going to see "Babe" Ruth knock
	a home run, and nothing else mat?
	tered.
	Civic pride, inter-city rivalry, in?
	terest in the national game were
	minor considerations. The "Babe"
	was not due to "bust one."
	IN CLEVELAND 1 was talking
	to two tired business men early
	in the afternoon.
	Said one of them gravely:
	"This 'Babe' Ruth is a menace. He
	is responsible to a large degree for
	i the lack of production in these
	: manufacturing towns around the
	Lakes. Go out to the ball park to?
	day and you will see thousands of
	young men taking the afternoon off
	just to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust one.'

	<text>"BABE" RIJTH'S SALARY
	"Babe Ruth," baseball star, is to receive a
	salary of seventy-five thousand dollars this year,
	with an additional five hundred dollars for every
	home run he bats out. On the basis of his last
	season's record this should bring his income for
	the coming eight, months' work up to well over the
	hundred thousand dollar mark.
	To many this will seem arf^rtjtf^Sbe. Thej^-will
	point out the fact that the President of the United
	States draws only seventy-five thousand dollars a
	year that the Secretary of State gets but twelve
	jthousand that the salaries of most of our gover
	in&rs and college'presidents average around ten
	thousand dollars a year. These are vocations that
	require years of training, of research, and the
	hardest kind of work.
	Yet, along comes a baseball swatter with no
	special intelligence, and gobbles up a salary great-: h^f^I VutyT
	er than that attached to the greatest office in the
	land.
	Critics of "Babe" Ruth's salary should not for­
	get that thley are living in America. This is a
	j.free land and it offers opportunity for advance
	jment to every citizen. What better proof is need­
	ed than these very facts albout "Babe" Ruth. An
	orphan, with no parents to guide his steps and yet
	with all his handicaps he is raised to the seats of
	the mighty,' with a salary that exceeds those of
	the mighty.
	It cannot be luck. Ruth 'has specialized. He
	has trained. He has made himself the ibaseball
	swat king of America. His name is known from
	coast to coast. His admirers are legion.
	America cannot cry down the salary "Babe"
	Ruth gets. His work is measured by his follow­
	ers, and it is the people who indirectly pay him.
	He is the best in his field. America offers sim­
	ilar opportunities in every line to every citizen,
	and should not be afraid to boast of it. As Emer­
	son so aptly put it a generation ago:
	"If you can make a better mousetrap than your
	neighbor, the world will make a beaten pathway
	to your door."—Minneapolis Journal,

	BABE RUTH LIKELY TO DRAW PENALTY FOR EFFORT TO PROTECT HIMSELF
	WASHINGTON TIMES SPORTS
	FRIDAY, MAY 26, 1922.
	F
	Suspension Likely for Ruth,
	But Incident Draws Attention
	to Fans' Cowardice.
	By lolls A. HOLGHKR.
	Babe Ruth is likely to he pun
	ished severely for entering the
	grandstand at the Polo Grounds,
	New York, and seeking to ham
	mer an insulting fan. There are
	two sides to every question and
	the ball player has an excellent
	argument to offer in partial pal
	liation of his offense.
	Ban Johnson is expected to sus
	pend the Yankees' home-run hit
	ter for ten days. He may impose
	a heavy fine on the player. But
	Ban Johnson will do the game a
	great good if he will investigate
	conditions surrounding the inci
	dent at the Polo Grounds.
	It Is admitted that Babe Ruth
	ov?rratepped the hounds on the play
	ing field when, called out stretching
	his single, he tossed a handful of
	dirt at Umpire Hildebrand. He wps |
	ejected from the game for that, then ?
	and there.
	It is admitted that Ruth commiited
	a cardinal offense when he lef< the I
	playing field and sought to beat up |
	one of his insulters. He is vet to.
	be punished for that.
	Nevertheless\ Bah* Rulli and |
	every other player In ihe ma.ntr
	leagues is entitled io prole? limi
	from insult and injury on the par!
	of the public. It is all tnirutivrnt
	for a club owner to say he cannot
	stop the Rood of villifi? at ion such
	as we heard shouted at Rulli yes
	terday snd Wednesday.
	?
	Babe Ruth is a young man. He ?
	la lio better anil no worse ih.in any
	?ther man.
	Babe Ruth, because he can hit I
	home runs, has been raised on a
	pinnacle extending wcllnigh lo tho ?
	skies. If it has turned his h?ed. |
	there ia good reason.
	Babe Ruth, be? atise he has not *
	been hitting home runs in every !
	game since his return to the New
	Tork lineup, ha? been the tarnet ;
	for Insults shocking to one not ac- I
	customed to them.

	Ban Expresses Sorrow
	For Ruth's Wild
	Deed on Field
	CHICAGO, May 26.?"I am
	sorry to hear that," waa the
	comment of Ban Johnson,
	American League president,
	when informed that Ruth had
	kicked over the traces in yes
	terday's Yankee-Senator game
	at the Polo Grounds in New
	York.
	Johnson was unable to say
	what action .he would take in
	the matter. He will be guided
	by what Umpires Nallin and
	Hildebrand have to say in their
	telegraphic reporta of the af
	fair.
	insult rose to Its height In the
	seventh Inning .when Ruth fail???! to
	hit safely, with two out and the
	bases loaded.
	In yesterday's game the chorur of
	"boos" began with his first appear
	ance at the plate. His sacrifico bunt
	only added fuel to the fire.
	No man pun>_u_Ug a ticket in
	a ball game haa any inherent right
	to Insult the player? with woids
	he would not dare use were he
	anywhere else. It is the duty of
	the umpire to rail attention of this
	situation to the club owner, li la
	the latter's duty to take such
	measures as will halt the Insults.
	I_cking such protection by bolli
	umpire and magnate, the player
	may be expected to do something
	in his own, defense, even when that
	action is distinctly against the ruirs
	of the league. His action may not
	be justified under those rules, but
	to the average man they are entire
	ly Justifiable.
	Ruth committed a cardinal offense
	when he climbed Into the ?tauri.
	Those fans make It possible for
	him to be the highest-paid liall
	player in the business.. Without
	those fans, there would be no bute
	ball played at all, save as a matter
	of exercise.
	if Ruth were an ancient phil
	osopher, he might sit down, swallow
	his chagrin at the turn ln the tide
	and wait for better days. But Ruth
	is a young man. a professional
	athlete raised in one season to the
	heights of popular success. He Is
	maklnii more money than dozens of
	men together. It is but natura.] for
	him to he shocked at what has
	happened since he returned to the
	New Tork lineup.
	If Ruth knew much nf the old
	Athenian Kccle.sia he might
	ponder on the fate of great gen
	erais and ?tatemen at the hands
	?if Ihe mob. He probably never
	Inaid of the t.?'desia. If he did,
	he might not be a ball player.
	He who in lifted to the akiea by
	popular acclaim may be Just as
	easily and even more quickly hurle?!
	into the depths by that same public ?
	Ruth is undergoing such experiente
	now.
	In 1911 Ty Cobb. suffering from
	similar insults, rushed into th?? |
	stund at the Yankees' old Hilltop
	park snd severely chaatlsed a fan
	He was fined and suspended for ten ?
	days, causing a strike on the pert
	of the entire Detroit club. Hox\ -
	ever, the fine and suspenakin stuck
	and the Detroit club was Induced to
	play ball. ? rule was then adopta??!
	by the American league seeking to
	prevent ?a repltition of such sn ai ?.
	Yesterday's affair In New York Is
	the first since 1911. though Harrv
	Courtney attempted to stage such ri
	foolish act st Georgia avenue last
	fall.
	Rahe Ruth is known aa an easy
	going man on the field. He leads
	no riots. He gives all he hss to his
	team on the field. In 1919 he
	swung on Umpire Brick Owens and
	was suspended for five days, but
	that was the one rough act In his
	career until yesterday.

	<text>Babe Ruth, Hero of the Great American Game
	(Continued from page one)
	manufacturers coming to when this
	sort of thing happens?"'
	"Gentlemen," I said softly, "what
	are you going to do this afternoon?"
	The duet came spontaneously:
	"Why, we are going out to the
	ball park to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust
	one' Do you think that he is due
	to 'bust one' to-day?"
	In Cleveland a Cincinnati judge
	saw the Yankees every day with his
	young son. As a reward ho had
	rashly promised his heir that he
	would take him to see "Babe" Ruth
	"bust one," and like an honest parent
	he had to trail with the Yankees
	until the "Babe" did "bust one." It
	took some time and something like
	$1,000 in fares and hotel money. For
	nobody can tell when the "Babe" is
	due to "bust one."
	The multitudes groan when the
	pitchers pass Ruth purposely, but it
	is not the function of the opposing
	pitchers to make home runs easj
	for "Babe" Ruth. The game must
	not be permitted to become a mere
	background for the Colossus.
	One pitcher was asked:
	"What is the best way to pitch te
	'Babe' Ruth?"
	The reply was terse and explicit
	"Don't pitch to him at all."
	Fc*r "Babe" Ruth can hit any kine
	of curve, and he can hit a fast one
	or a slow one. He has chalked up at
	Ileast one home run against every
	pitcher of any importance in his own
	? league, and it is safe to predict that
	if he takes part in a world's series
	: he will extend the list of his vic?
	tims to the other league, if the other
	'league's pitchers will pitch to him.
	_
	THE reason that "Babe" Ruth
	' can hit all pitchers and hit
	them harder than any player?
	It is not his enormous strength, his
	keen eye and his baseball cunning.
	Many players have possessed either
	or all of these to the same degree as
	Ruth. It must be the perfect coor?
	dination of eye, mind and muscle, the
	reflex, some have called it.
	This is not something that can be
	developed, for many have tried. Jim
	Thorpe, the Indian, the greatest all
	around athlete in the world, had a
	stronger physique than Ruth, as keen
	an eye and as keen a mind. But Jim
	Thorpe, though he willed it with all
	determination, could not become even
	a passable big league ballplayer.
	With all the attributes of a great hit?
	ter, he could not hit.
	The verdict when they passed him
	to the minors was that he "was a
	sucker for a curved ball." "Babe"
	Ruth has an uncanny instinct for
	gauging the dazzling flight of the
	ball. I have seen him pull a swing
	?that is to say, at the flash when
	the ball left the pitcher's hand to
	an instant before it came close to
	him, he sensed that it was beyond
	reach and stayed the swing of his
	bat midway.
	You who have watched Ruth swing
	will appreciate the difficulty of this
	feat. He swings with every muscle
	of his body. All his weight is be?
	hind the drive. There are not many
	players who can check the swing,
	and only Ruth's power that could
	start the Ruthian swing could check
	! it. once started. And with the power
	there must be the perfect coordina?
	tion that is in the most marvelous
	machinery or in the most primitive
	human creature.
	THERE is something gloriously;
	primitive about Ruth. The j
	most striking picture I ever!
	saw of him was at Cleveland, during ?
	the series there.
	Ruth has one defective knee, a
	knee that slips out of joint every:
	now and then. This accident hap- '
	pened to him in Cleveland, in the '.
	midst of a game which we conven- '
	tionally describe as "crucial."
	Von have seen those pictures or
	have read the descriptions of the
	grizzly pierced with many arrows
	in a Sierra epic. He growls and he
	bites at the arrows in a blind rage.
	He tears at his own smarting flesh
	with his claws. Well, Ruth was very
	much like that wounded grizzly.
	He sat down on that second base
	sack and pounded at the knee with
	his fists, trying to set it back into
	place. He put one hand on his thigh
	?and the other'on the lower part of
	the leg, tugging and trying to reset
	the sliding joint. Then he shouted
	to "Ping" Bodie, who had rushed
	out to see how badly he was hurt:
	"Bring me a ball bat! Maybe we
	can hammer this thing back into
	place."
	WHAT manner of man is this,
	our "Babe" Ruth, in various
	other respects?
	I do not wish to say that there are
	clay feet on any popular idol, nor do
	I care to say that all popular idols
	are of wondrous white marble. I
	will maintain that Ruth is far
	worthier of idolatry than many other
	sporting idols.
	Observe this point. You seldom
	hear of "Babe" Ruth quarreling with
	the umpire. I know of other baseball
	heroes who have wrangled with um?
	pires when they were in the wrong,
	knowing that the mob would be with
	them and against the umpire. Ruth
	has the native sense of. fairness not
	to do this. That in itself is a big
	thing in a game where there is not
	a great deal of the spirit of fairness.
	Let's not lady-journalize and psy?
	chologize our popular idol. Let us
	watch in readiness to toss our straw
	hats into the field as he soaks the
	pill beyond the horizon.
	In Valhalla, the Elysian Fields or
	in whatever place his breed eventu?
	ally gather, he will some day lay
	down beside the club of Hercules and
	the hammer of Thor the heavy
	ashen bat of "Babe" Ruth, and it
	will not seem out of place there.
	last June, when Herr Breitscheid,
	the Independent leader, said that
	the plan of deporting Belgians and
	Frenchmen to forced labor in Ger?
	many was conceived by Stinnes;
	that von Bissing, the Governor Gen?
	eral of Belgium, carried out the de?
	portations virtually under Stinnes'?
	direction, that the destruction of
	workshops and wholesale theft of
	machinery in Belgium and Northern
	France were suggested by him.
	These revelations were recently
	supplemented by a correspondent of
	The London Times, who reported
	that to-day it is an open secret in
	Germany that Stinnes drew up the
	pian for the destruction of French
	coal mines, and by a writer in
	L'Europe Nouvelle, who stated
	Stinnes had bought up for 28,000,
	000 francs a large block of Belgian
	enterprises, including public utilities,
	coal fields, iron mines and worKs.
	The method of this colossal transac?
	tion?one that would have give
	Stinnes the control of practically the
	entire supply of coal in Continental
	Europe had Germany remained
	victorious?was characteristic. In
	order to avoid publicity Stinnes
	stipulated that the purchase price
	should be paid six months after the
	conclusion of peace: needless to say,
	by peace he meant a German peace,
	with Belgium and parts of North?
	ern France annexed.</text>

	I HIT
	Bide tins list home mi
	I’ve never yet won an Academy Award in
	all my years as an actor. But I wouldn’t
	swap the memory of my performance at
	Yankee Stadium on Sunday, May 9,1948, for
	all the Oscars in Hollywood, even though not
	a single drama critic was on hand to hail it.
	When Allied Artists tapped me to star in
	"The Babe Ruth Story,” a lot of Hollywood
	wise guys looked at each other with knowing
	glances. I think Allied Artists even glanced
	knowingly at itself. For one thing, I wasn’t
	a ballplayer. I had played a pretty passable
	outfield as a kid in school, but I didn’t look a
	bit like Ruth in action. I was a long way from
	being a ringer for him in appearance. Nature
	hadn’t endowed me with either his balloon
	ing midriff or his spindly, toothpick ankles.
	10
	Baseball is full of surprises, but this
	one topped them all. The 35,000 fans at
	Yankee Stadium couldn't believe their eyes
	By William Bendix
	Star of NBC-TV’s “Life of Riley ” Program
	But there was one asset I did have for the
	role and Allied knew it: I was a Babe Ruth
	worshiper from way back. As a kid in New
	York I had put in a long stretch as locker
	room boy and bat boy for the Yankees.
	When Babe Ruth’s stomach growled from
	hunger which was about once per inning
	I was the lucky kid who ran to get his hot
	dogs. He was the hero I wanted to be when
	I grew up.
	My huddle with the producers the day they
	sounded me out about' playing Babe Ruth was
	more like a major-league contract discussion
	than a casting meeting.
	"Can you hit?” they asked.
	"I may be able to come through with a few
	Texas Leaguers.” I told them. My throwing
	was weak and my fielding spotty, I had to
	admit. But Allied Artists had only two alter
	natives: make an actor out of Babe Ruth, or
	a hitter out of me.
	The decision to try the latter course soon
	led to a complete repeal of the old proverb,
	practice makes perfect. Practice made me
	lousy and while the directors wrung
	their hands I got blisters on mine. The
	best I could wangle was an occasional
	dribble to the pitcher's box.
	"Okay, Bill,” director Roy Del Ruth (no
	relation to the Babe) said to me one day.
	"Just swing and try to look good. We’ll use
	camera tricks to fake the home runs. The
	sound-effects man will supply the crack of the
	bat and the cameramen will show a ball
	dropping into the right-field stands.”
	Even taking a convincing cut at the ball
	was tough for me because, to {day Babe Ruth,
	I had to learn a complete new stance: I had
	to learn how to swing left-handed.
	The labs Arrives
	A few weeks after the shooting of the film
	began, the Babe himself got up out of a hospi
	tal bed and arrived, ailing and haggard, in
	Hollywood to coach me in his pigeon-toed
	batting stance. His tutoring helped me bran
	dish the bat with a swaggering air and glare
	menacingly at the pitcher. But it didn’t lift
	my batting average much above zero.
	In May. 1948, a skeleton crew and part of
	the cast came East to film the final scene in
	Yankee Stadium. The background for this

	Conditions at the ball park were an exact

	were 35,000 fans on hand. The team in the

	<text>THE IMMIGRATION PERIL.
	President Masaryk of Prague Univers
	ity Points It Out.
	BALTIMORE, May 10.?President Thomas
	Garigne Masaryk of the University of
	Prague and member of Austrian reichsrath,
	now In this city, says in an interview Jhat
	he looks upon foreign immigration as a
	peril to the American republic. "I have
	observed," he said, "one very vital ques
	tion that should concern America more
	than all others, namely, the immigration
	problem. From my observations in the im
	migration quarters of New York I have
	been led to believe the situation is really
	alarming. Here you have on an average
	of a half million Immigrants coming to
	your shores annually, for the most part un
	educated, among them great numbers of
	Italians, Syrians, Turks and Greeks. ^ ou
	cannot imagine what it means to have
	these people suddenly liberated from the
	political, religious and social bonds under
	which they have lived for centuries. Com
	paratively few seem to see the danger that
	lurks behind this condition. A half mil
	lion immigrants means about chil
	dren in five years. Who takes care of
	thtm?
	"Go to New York and you find them
	fairly swarming about the streets of the
	East Side from early morning until late
	in the evening. Then go to the oth^r
	section of the city and you notice the con
	trast. In the one place thousands of igno
	rant children playing in the filth of the
	smaller streets and alleys and in the other
	neatly clad children with school books in
	their arms.
	"It is safe to say that the condition in
	the former case, under the present cir
	cumstances, when no care is manifested
	for the welfare of the offspring of the for
	eigners. will not naturally become allevi
	ated in less than the third to tne fifth gen
	eration.
	"There is only one remedy that I can
	think of. and that is to organize a n.o\e
	ment to take care of these children, edu
	cate them and by so doing elevate thei;'
	moral condition." I

	<text>PROFESSOR MASARYK HERE.
	3Iailt an Address to Bohemians af
	National Hall.
	Professor T. G. Masaryk of Pra-ue. Bo
	hemia, yesterday afternoon made a talk to
	about 150 of his countrymen at the Bohe
	mian National Hall. Dolman street and Al
	len avenue.
	It had been announced that he would de
	liver two lectures In St. LouK one Satur
	day and one yesterday, but he did not reach
	the city In time for the Saturday date, hav
	ing missed a train In Chicago Saturday
	mornlnc. '
	Several Bohemians gathered Saturday
	evenlnsr. onlv to be disappointed, and. as the
	changing of dates could not be properly
	advertied. both lectures were called off.
	At the urgent request of the Bohemlxn
	Amerlcan Club, he made the talk ve'terdav
	afternoon, ppeakinu of tho political situation
	and the alms of Bohemia. He attributes the
	debility of his race to Its enslavement slnca
	tho Fifteenth Century, and notnted out the
	Kreat strides it has mane jnce belnK lib
	erated, in 1SW. He anrued tnat education Is
	the remedy, and told of the sstem of
	schools now being established by the state.
	Professor Masaryk is not In favor of the
	Rcneral opposition of his people to the Ger
	mans, and thinks th two race, by enltln?
	on a democratic basis, could accomplish
	more than by antagonizing each other. He
	urged the American-Bohemians to adopt
	the language and customs of this country,
	but not to forget their history and national
	ideals.
	Professor Masaryk was Invited to this
	country by the Chicago University, to de
	liver a series of lectures. He will go back
	to Europe the last of the month.

	<text>BOHEMIAN LEADER LECTURES
	Head of His Party Austrian Par
	liament Addresses Omaha
	C'onntrymen.
	' Dr. T. G. Masaryk, leader of the Bo
	hemian progressive democratic party In the
	Austrian Parliament and the head of the
	department of social philosophy In Prague
	university, , arrived In Omaha Tuesday
	afternoon and addressed the Bohemians of
	the city In the evening.
	"Great social reforms are being brought
	about In my country," said Prof. Masaryk,
	when seen at his hotel by a reporter for
	the Bee. "Prior to this year we did not
	even have universal suffrage. Only those
	who had property sufficient to pay a tax
	of 2 were allowed to vote.
	"The institution of universal suffrage
	gives a vote to every man twenty-four
	years old or older. Three great changes
	have been wrought by this reform. First,
	the aristocracy as a party has disappeared
	from the Parliament. In the old govern
	ment body the aristocray was very strong
	In numbers and supremely powerful In
	passing measures which often favored none
	but the rich. There are still aristocrats In
	the parliament, but they are no longer very
	strong.
	Secondly, the institution of universal suf
	frage has brought in many socialists. Out
	of 818 members there are eighty-seven social
	democrats In the body. This Is a greater
	number than any other country has In Its
	governing body. Other parliaments have
	socialists as follows: Germany, forty-three;
	France, fifty; Belgium, thirty; Denmark,
	twenty-four; United States, none.
	A third reault of the universal auflrage
	la the Incoming to the Parliament of the
	clerical Catholics. There are a number of
	these and they seek to get possession of
	the educational system. They are on tho
	one side and the social democrats on the
	ether.
	"My purpose In, this country Is chiefly
	to deltver an address before the Interna
	tional Congress of Religious Thinkers and
	Workers, which meets In Boston September
	77. I am traveling over the rest of the
	country to meet my fellow countrymen. I
	find them everywhere In positions of pros
	perity, which makes me proud to own them
	as my countrymen."
	Prof. Mararyk married an American wo
	man, the daughter of Rudolph Garrigue of
	New York, founder ot the Germania Ins
	sura nee company. lie will sail from New
	Tork October 1 for hia home In order ti
	be In Austria for the opening of Parliament
	In the middle cf October.
	Tuesday evening Prof. Masaryk addressed
	ceveral hundred of his coutryinen at Bo
	hemian Turner hall. Thirteenth and Dorcas
	streets. In his speech, given In Bohemian,
	he outlined the polttkal situation as It
	la now In Austria and particularly In Bo
	hemian Austria. He touched upon the ef-
	!
	CURES
	o SIOI1 DISEASES
	and the clerical parties by this mensure,
	although they ara at two extremes of po
	litical policy. After the lecture a number
	of questions were put to him. which he
	answered. He waa asked what he believed
	would be the destiny of the different mem
	iers of the Austrian empire If the present
	emperor should die.
	"I do jiot think It would disintegrate,"
	he replied, "as Is Indicated by gome of the
	dispatcher In this country. The Bohemians
	want to belong to a large and powerful
	notion, consequently they are perfectly
	willing for the Austrian empire to retain
	Its strength."
	Today Prof. Masaryk speaks in Schuyler.

	Way to See Wilson
	CHICAGO, May 5.?Professor Thom?
	as Garigue Masaryk, leader of 12,000,
	000 Czech-Slovaks in their effort to
	escape from the yoke of Austrian rule,
	was greeted by thousands of Bohemi?
	ana upon his arrival here to-day, on
	his way to Washington, where he will
	present a plea for the freeedom of Bo?
	hemia to President Wilson.
	Professor Masaryk, who is hailed as
	th? Garibaldi of Bohemia, was a mem?
	ber of the Vienna Parliament and of
	the faculty of the University of
	Prague. Soon after the war broke out
	he fled from Austria and became .i
	leader of the Czech-Slovak revolution,
	inaugurating a mighty movement for
	an independent Bohemia.
	The new Bohemia as seen by Pro?
	fessor Masaryk will have a population
	of. about 12,000,000 persons speaking
	one language, and will stand as a bul?
	wark between Germany and her
	dreams bf Balkan domination. The
	new nation would include Bohemia,

	<text>Prof. Masaryk Here Tells
	3,000 of Plan to Raise
	50,000 Men in Russia
	Three thousand Czecho-Slovaks who
	filled Carnegie Hall to capacity, and as
	many more who thronged the streets
	about the building, tendered a stirring
	ovation last night to Professor Thomas
	Garrigue Masaryk, popular idol of the
	Bohemian people and champion of the
	| rights of the Czecho-Slovak nations
	seeking freedom from Austrian rule.
	Professor Masaryk was introduced by
	I Nicholas Murray Butler, president of
	j Columbia University, as one of the "six
	j wisest men in the world." The audi
	j ence, rising to its feet, cheered for
	six or seven minutes. Professor Mas
	j aryk's address was punctuated through
	? out with continuous applause.
	i "There are nineteen nations from
	i the Baltic to the Mediterranean seok
	I ing liberty from Teutonic aggression,"
	i Professor Masaryk declared, "and it is
	these nations which Germany hopes to
	enslave in order to realize her dreams
	I of an empire in middle Europe' and
	j control of Asia. Those opposing Gar
	j many will never be secure until this
	; dream of conquest is shattered. Rou
	j mania, the Russian provinces, Serbia
	and all Czecho-Slovak nations must be
	I set free, and President Wilson has de
	| clared it America's intention to wage
	| war until such freedom is obtained."
	Praises Gettysburg Address.
	Whether or not Americans are well
	acquainted with the history of Bohemia
	and her struggle against Austria, Pro?
	fessor Masaryk made it clear that Bo
	hernia was well acquainted with Amer?
	ica and her ideals, for he told that
	Lincoln's declaration of a "Government
	for the people and by the people" has
	been the watchword of Boh?mia for
	many years.
	"I stood at Gettysburg a few days
	since," said Professor Masaryk "and
	read Lincoln's immortal address. His
	words have been dear to the hearts of
	my people."
	Professor Masaryk told how Austria
	had misused the T hemian and Czecho?
	slovak people since Bohemia entered
	into a federation with her in 1526.
	"She never conquered the Bohe?
	mians," he declared amidst wild cheer?
	ing, "she tricked and betrayed them.
	They must and will be free. The
	Czecho-slovaks are the barrier between
	Germany and the Asiatic world, and it
	is all important that all aid possible
	be given them in their efforts to balk
	Austria."
	Professor Masaryk spoke hopefully
	of Russia and said the fiart the Allied
	nations should play toward her was
	one of aid and assistance rather than
	ceusure. ' He said that Austria, made
	up of nine nations, seven of whom are
	oppressed and held in thrall, was a
	nation in name only. He declared that
	Austria could never free herself from
	Germany and had become a vassal
	state also that Austrian and German
	idels were the erne?'tyranny and mis?
	rule.
	Organizes Army for Allies.
	The meeting was held under the aus?
	pices of the Bohemian National Alli?
	ance and the Slovak League. Professor
	Masaryk ' is the president of the
	Czecho-slovak National Council in
	Europe, organized by him to fight
	against Austrian rule. Educated in
	Austrian universities and founder of
	the Progressive party in Bohemia, for
	the last forty years he has moulded
	the thought of Slav students. He has
	just returned from Russia where he ;
	organized the Czech and Slovak prison?
	ers of war into an army of 50,000, and
	another corps of the same size is being
	formed to fight with the Allies. His i
	declaration that the Czecho-slovaks
	would fight with France, England and
	America caused tremendous cheering.
	Mrs. W. R. Wilcox, of the Red Cross,
	made a short address to the gathering
	in which she praised the way in which
	the Czeeho-s?ovaks in America had
	supported, the war and its ideal!?. A
	large contribution was taken up by
	Red Cross workers. The chairman of
	the reception committee and in charge
	of the affair was Vincent W. Woytisek.,</text>

	of' the Central Towers In the world war
	by a Slavonic audience which packed
	Carnegie Hall to the doors.

	Masar; left the stage for n brief In
	terval ,t response to their demands for
	sight of the man who heads the
	.Ciecho-Slovak wttlonal Council. Ills
	Pliearance was -the signal for n dem
	oristratioti which rivalled the one Inside.
	Prof.- MasaryU, who was formerly n
	Wembcr of the' University of' Traeue
	faculty and a rsepilty for Moravia 111
	trie Austrian l'arltnin.nt, left Hussla In
	'March nnd landed at Vancouver, U. C.
	on the 29th of that month. He made his
	first public nppc.irnnce In the United
	States last night.
	Scathing denunciation of Austria
	Hungary and of Germany for their
	domlnntios over Slavonic peoples was
	the keynote of his address. He told of
	'-thousands of Bohemian soldiers, forced
	to fight-against their will for Austria,
	.who had deserted to the Allies at the
	first opportunity and who were now
	bearing arms against their former mas-
	ttrs.
	' Ormnlinl Army at flO.OOl).
	l'rof. Masaryk spoke of having or
	'tanlsed an army of fiO.000 men from
	Slav prisoners, tnken by the Allies, and
	said they were at present on tho battle
	fronts in France nnd Italy, Another
	army of r.0,000 more would soon be
	formed, he said.
	During the reign of .Emperor Krans
	Josef, he charged, the Austrian Govern
	ment had executed 30,000, "and perhaps
	dO.OOft," of Ills rare, in Hddltlon many
	thousands more who wero In the army
	had been put rr death, he asserted.
	"If such an Austrian atrocity Is pos
	sible I suppose we have the right and
	duty to Fever all our connection wltn
	Austria and tho Hapsburgs," said he.
	"Our. nation has the natural right to re
	volt and be free. We must get rid of
	Austria-Hungary. Wo are not satisfied
	If Austria grants us autonomy. A fed
	eration has been suggested. Will that
	satisfy us? Not We will bo Independ
	ent and must be Independent.
	"Thin Is not only for our own Interest,
	but for the Interest of nil other nations
	in Km ope. Poland was divided among
	three robbers. We have mutual, cultural
	and political relations. We shall be free
	If they are, and they wilt be free If we
	are. We are all bound to unite for life
	and death against Germany,"
	Prof, Mnsar.ik said the peace of Eu
	rope and of the world depended upon the
	freedom of nineteen small nations bor
	dering Germany and Austria on the east,
	stretching from the Baltic Sea to Greece.
	"Only their freedom will give a, peace
	to Europe nnd to mankind which will
	be lasting," he said.
	WorM Domination Sonsht.
	Austria was no longer actually Inde
	pendent, he asserted, but was really a
	vassal of Germany. He said tho Cen
	tral Powers planned to subjugate the
	oast and then repeat the process with
	Great Britain and the United States and
	thus obtain world domination,
	'The Germans not only have the lust
	of conquest, but the conviction that they
	are a higher race a nation of lords
	nnd that nil others nro a nation of
	slaves," asserted Prof. Masaryk. "But
	the German plot for a central Europe
	has been overcome. America Is the new
	wall and may be the leader of all man
	kind. We wish not world power, but
	world union by agreement of free na
	tions. Germany is a (treat power, but
	tho help of America must decldo the
	struggle In favor of mankind and hu
	manlty."
	Prof. Masnryk urged that the Allies
	help to organize a free, democratic
	Russia, and admitted that the present
	Government there had not been what
	Was hoped for. He said tho task was a
	vast and difficult one, but that Germany
	must not be allowed to control a na
	tion of 130,000,000 Inhabitants.
	Nicholas Murray Butler, president of
	Columbia University, who was chairman
	of the meeting, Introduced Prof. Masaryk
	as having been mentioned to him re
	centry as "one of the half dozen wisest
	mfn In tho world."-America, he said
	was' determined that small nations
	should be free.
	Before the meeting there was a pa
	rade, which started In Avenue A and
	marched down Fifth avenue, Iti which
	all tho Bohemian-and Slovak societies In
	the city took part, many of them garbed
	In their quaint national costumes. There
	was a mounted detachment of young
	Moravians, all or whom were natives of
	the district where Prof. Masaryk was
	born.</text>

	<text>LIGHTING THE SLAV BOMB
	IN AUSTRIA
	Subject Peoples Getting Together
	For First Time in History to
	Resist Oppression
	Who is Masaryk?
	On Saturday evening, May 25, ten
	thousand Bohemians, Slovaks and other
	Slavs, marched down Fifth Avenue,
	many of tho men and women garbed
	in their striking national dress, in
	honor of Masaryk. Half of this num?
	ber crowded into Carnegie Hall, while
	the remainder waited outside hoping
	for an opportunity to seo him. The
	meeting was in his honor. Those out?
	side were so insistent in their demands
	for a glimpse of Masaryk that he was
	forced to leave the platform and show
	himself to the throng.
	When President Butler of Columbia
	University introduced him to the great
	audience as one of the half-dozen lead?
	ing statesmen of the world the floor
	of heads rose to a new level and broke
	into a tossing sea of color and sound.
	The boxes, tier after tier, and those
	in the seats in the far-off fourth
	heaven took up the shouting and the
	tumult. Bohemian and American flags
	waved. For five minutes the tumult
	continued.
	What was there about the man which
	had made him such a popular hero?
	Was it his magnetic presence? The
	spare man who stood before them was
	sixty-eight years old. A thin gray
	mustache and beard scarcely hid the
	sensitive lips. The fine contour of his
	head was easily followed, for his hair
	was a thin fringe. There he stood,
	in sombre evening dress, the color
	mounting to his cheeks occasionally as
	he glanced through his glasses out
	over the tumultuous throng, a quiet,
	scholarly looking man,
	Perhaps he possessed oratorical
	powers which would sway men as an
	artist swings his brush.
	He began slowly in a low tono ol
	voice. It ros? a little as he proceeded
	but seldom did it take on the forcefu
	tones of the trained and confident ora
	tor. He was never at a loss, however
	for a word. Occasionally he strokec
	his face thoughtfully, passing his hanc
	from his eyes downward over his moutl
	to his chin. That seemed strange foi
	a speaker in Carnegie Hall, where i
	is difficult enough to be heard unde:
	any circumstances. Evidently he wai
	not striving for oratorical effect. Ii
	fact, what he said smacked of thi
	scholar in the study. He was not ?
	great speechmaker such as we expec
	leaders in a democracy to be. Only one
	did he exhibit his power over his audi
	ence. For a moment he addressee
	those before him in his and their na
	tive tongue. He spoke with the sam
	slow, careful choosing of words. Sud
	denly, raising his arm to a horizonte
	position, he pointed straight out wit'
	the index finger. A single sentenc
	accompanied this gesture. It was as i
	a conductor had raised his baton an
	his chorus had risen to its feet i
	front of him. The great audience be
	fore him rose as one man and stoo
	in serried ranks, obedient to his singl
	word.
	The Keynote of
	His War Policy
	Was his message the key to his popt
	larity? It semed as he delivered
	a simply told tale. It was his idea c
	why the war could not be won for tr
	Allies unless Austria-Hungary was di?
	memb?red, and the different small n;
	tions comprising it eacH had an o]
	portunity for freedom such as Americ
	possesses, founded upon the principle
	of the Declaration of Independence. ?
	long as Bohemia, astride the highwf
	from Berlin to Vienna, Budapest ar
	the Danube and the Black Sea, wi
	antagonistic to the Central Europes
	monarchies there could be no pea<
	nor any Mitteleuropa. There is no Au
	tria, only a family supporting itself I
	trickery at the expense of many small !
	nationalities. Therefore, why should
	Austria continue to exist? As all the
	oppressed peoples of Austria-Hungary
	feel thus about it and the friendship
	of Italy has been secured for their
	aims, it is possible to erect a barrier
	across Middle Europe from the Baltic
	to the Adriatic which will control the
	Danube and the rail routes to Constan?
	tinople and the Black Sea. In fighting
	for her age-old independence, Bohemia
	is fighting for thi safety of democracy
	for the world.
	"There are nineteen nations from the
	Baltic to Greece," said he. "This pecu?
	liar zone is the barrier of Germany to?
	ward the East. Mitteleuropa is what
	the Holy Roman Empire was, a plan
	for subjugating the East. Austria, to?
	day, while nominally free, actually is
	governed from Berlin. Austria never
	could be opposed to Germany. The idea
	of Germany is that Germans are super
	! human and the Slavs are slaves. The
	? phrase, 'Berlin-Bagdad,' could be bet?
	ter expressed 'Berlin-Cairo.' Africa is
	Germany's aim. Germany thinks of
	mastering Europe, Asia, Africa. The
	Allies are thinking of all countries, the
	new with the old. The new world may
	be the leader of all mankind,
	"The programme which the Bohe?
	mians, Poles and South Slavs and other
	small nationalities are urging is not
	that of mastering Germany geograph?
	ically, but the necessary plans of hu?
	manity. We care not for war power,
	but for a world based on the agree?
	ments of free nations. It will be Amer?
	ica that will aid most in settling this
	struggle for the high aims of mankind.
	The next stage of the evolution in the
	minds of the Germans is the control
	of Great Britain and the United States.
	It is the problem of socialism which
	we have before us. By socialism we
	mean that the rights of the small man
	as well as those of the great man are
	entitled to be recognized. The same
	idea extends to international relations.
	Small nations have the same rights as
	largo nations.
	"There are eight nations in Aus?
	tria, but Austria is not a a??ion. Aus?
	tria is the dynasty, the autocracy, the
	army. Austria-Hungary is an example
	of an artificial state just as Prussia
	is. These small nations are not a part
	of the same government because they
	are neighboring and have agreed to it,
	but because they have the same dy?
	nasty.
	"The aim of the future peace confer?
	ence is the organization of the east
	] of Europe. The unexpected result of
	I this war was the Russian revolution.
	Czarism has given place to something
	i not very strong. It is my conviction
	and that of many political thinkers
	? that Russia must be an organized
	democracy, and not the prey of Ger?
	many.
	"A reconstruction of mankind must
	be a result of this war. If Germany
	would only rely upon her own forces
	and not exploit other nations! If
	Germany will not exploit other nations
	I she can do what she likes. Every pol
	I icy that is only materialistic cannot
	; prevail. Democracy is the government
	of hearts over hearts, of souls over
	souls."
	As one listened to Masaryk there
	seemed nothing remarkable about his
	treatment of the great field he was
	'<: tilling. What he said seemed to one
	i the logical and appropriate thing tc
	\ say. It was said with so little em
	I phasis that the largeness of his con?
	ception did not at once manifest itself
	! He left his ideas to grow in such soi!
	! as they found congenial.
	Thomas Garrique Masaryk, a pro
	I fessor of philosophy, politics anc
	| sociology in the University of Prague
	THOMAS G. MASARYK
	a man who has never held a political
	office except that of member of the
	Reichsrat, is a statesman because of
	his ideas. Ideas, a high sense of the
	importance of ethical values, fearless?
	ness, a willingness to support unpopu?
	lar causes, a modesty which lends him
	to gain his ends through the activities
	of others?these arc some of the char?
	acteristics which have placed Masaryk
	at the head of the Austrian revolu?
	tionary movement. By temperament he
	is a realist and a Liberal. He looks
	for the facts and faces them in a prac?
	tical way. He founded the Bohemian
	Realist party, that of the intellectuals.
	His Liberal tendency was guided by his
	wife, a daughter of Rudolph Garrique,
	of Brooklyn, founder of a well known
	New York insurance company. He
	met her, it is said, in Leipsic, where
	he was a university student and study?
	ing music. As a token of his affection
	for her, he adopted her family name
	as his own middle name. She gave
	him an insight into American institu?
	tions and led him into an appreciation
	of their value to humanity. For forty
	years he taught the principles of the
	American Declaration of Independence
	beneath the shades of the University of
	Prague.
	Tried Teacher
	Of Slav Youths
	Prague has long been the chief cen?
	tre of Slav literature and learning.
	The university is one of the oldest in
	Europe. Hither come the youth of all
	the Slav regions of Austria-Hungary.
	Before Masaryk's time the ideals of
	Slav unity were linguistic and literary.
	They were the visions of dreamers.
	Masaryk taught the later generations
	for a period of forty years to face
	facts as they were. As the political
	pressure grew greater he preached free?
	dom anel democratic forms of govern?
	ment. Political ideals were emphasized
	after the war broke out, when -all Slavs
	began to change their orientation and
	work for political union and democratic
	forms.
	Masaryk's character and teachings
	drew young men toward him. They
	came from every Slav region. Through
	a period of forty years he sowed mod?
	ern philosophical and political ideas
	throughout the Slav world of Austria
	Hungary.
	His courage strengthened his grip
	! upon the oppressed peoples of Austria
	! Hungary. On April 3 a Jew by the
	, name of Leopold Hilsner, was dis?
	charged from an Austrian penitentiary
	at the conclusion of a period of con
	; finement of nineteen years. The crime
	with which Hilsner was charged and
	! of which ho was convicted was the
	j murder of a nineteen-year-old Chris
	; tian girl, whose body was found in a
	: little grove near the town of Polna,
	| in Southeastern Bohemia. It was
	clearly indicated that the motive for
	| the crime was a desire to hide another
	crime, that of rape. The fact that the
	' victim had a large gash on her neck
	i was immediately seized upon by the
	? anti-Semitic agitators as a proof that
	i the young woman was murdered for
	1 the purpose of securing her blood for
	; ritualistic purposes. The "yellow"
	? press, especially the pan-German
	papers, exploited the affair and there
	was grave danger of Jewish "pogroms."
	Professor Masaryk was the only man
	who opposed the clamor. After a pains
	; taking examination of the evidence he
	i was able to prove that the crime was
	I certainly not one for obtaining blood
	i for ritualistic purposes. He also dis
	j proved the primitive notion which was
	the basis of the charge. The reaction?
	ary press and anti-Semite agitators
	| turned against him, insinuating that
	I he had been bribed by rich Jews. The
	I courts indicted him for interfering
	with the due process of law. His
	. courageous defence secured him the
	! attachment of the Jews throughout the
	| country.
	I Wins Leadership
	Of Southern Slavs
	Upon his election to the Reichsrat
	in 1907 he won the following of the
	South Slavs through his support and
	leadership of their cause. He boldly
	criticised the bureaucratic policy ol
	Austria toward the Serbo-Croats of
	Bosnia and rallied all his Slav col
	| leagues around him. This was one o?
	I the steps leading to the general recogni
	I tion of Dr. Masaryk as leader of all the
	! oppressed peoples of Austria. He cre
	| ated a sensation in Europe through his
	\ speech revealing Magyar tyranny in
	; Croatia. His speeches exposing the
	J forgeries upon which Aerenthal based
	i his Bosnian policy, and which nearly
	led to a war upon Serbia ten years age
	| were astonishing in their daring and
	Masaryk, Leader of Czech-Slovaks,
	in This Country to Prepare
	Way for Freedom
	completeness. Aerenthal could only sit
	without reply, guilty before the world.
	His defence of a group of thirty or
	forty Jugo-Slavs against charges of
	treason at his own expense strength?
	ened materially this political allegiance
	of the Southern Slav part of the Dual
	Monarchy. As a result of Masaryk's
	teachings the idea of a Serbo-Croat
	unity had been growing prior to 1907,
	Frano Supilo, a Southern Slav patriot,
	being the chief among the leaders. Of?
	ficial Austria and official Hungary made
	a deliberate attempt to use the grow?
	ing popularity of the idea as a lever
	for discrediting and attacking inde?
	pendent Serbia.
	"The full perfidy of the methods
	employed to this end," says Seton
	Wateon, an English authority on Cen?
	tral European affairs, "is still very
	inadequately realized in the West,
	though they threw a searching light
	not merely upon Austria-Hungary's
	traditional policy, but also upon one
	of the prime causes of the present
	war."
	A well directed press campaign pre?
	ceded the annexation of Bosnia in
	October, 1908, its object being that of
	suggesting that the leaders of the
	movement for unity were inspired, and
	directly financed from Belgrade. In?
	deed, these men, instead of voicing a
	genuine demand for nationality, were
	alleged to be actually in the pay of an
	alien dynasty conspiring to stir up
	trouble! Wholesale arrests followed.
	In March, 1909, a monster treason trial
	opened at Agram, capital cf Croatia.
	Amid many scandals it dragged along
	for seven months. As a means of in?
	timidation the governmental secret
	police organized a band of street ruf?
	fians to attack some of the Serbo
	Croat leaders in the chief streets of
	the city. Supilo was one of the vic?
	tims. There was risk of war with
	Russia as the Bosnian crisis dragged on.
	?Checking Another
	Austrian Move
	Aerenthal, Foreign Minister of Aus?
	tria, furnished to Heinrich Friedjung,
	Austria's leading historian, a formi?
	dable array of "documents" purporting
	to establish corrupt complicity between
	the Serbo-Croat leaders in a wide?
	spread revolutionary plot. This was
	supposed to have been organized by
	the Serbian government in Croatia and
	Bosnia. On the day fixed by the Aus?
	trian staff for a final rupture with
	Serbia the first instalment of Fried
	jung's "revelations" appeared in the
	"Neue Freie Presse." As it chanced
	on that very day Russia yielded tc
	the demonstrations of William II oi
	Prussia, and the danger of a Euro?
	pean war was temporarily removed
	The news reached Vienna so late thai
	night that Aerenthal was unable tc
	stop the publication of Friedjung's firsl
	instalment. It was the expectatior
	of the government to follow the publi?
	cation with the execution under mar?
	tial law of Supilo and other Serbo
	Croat leaders. The preservation oi
	peace put the shoe on the other foot
	and these leaders brought a libel suil
	against Dr. Friedjung.
	"The amazing revelations of the
	Friedjung trial," said Seton-Watsor
	recently, "cast an indelible stain upor
	Austria's diplomacy, and afford crush?
	ing proof of her bad faith toward
	Serbia. For the 'documents' upor
	which the defence relied were provee!
	(by Masaryk) to be impudent forgeries
	concocted by officials of the Austro
	Hungarian Legation in Belgrade, anc
	supplied en gros, with the connivance
	of the minister, to the Foreign Office
	in Vienna for the purpose of poisoning
	the wells of public opinion against
	Jugo-Slavg inside and outside the mon- i
	archy. These forgeries were far too
	gross to have deceived the merest
	child, and when Professor Masaryk on
	the floor of the Austrian delegation
	branded the guilty diplomatist as a
	second Azov, the spy and agent provo?
	cateur, the Foreign Minister remained
	seated in no less guilty silence."
	The qualities which won the Jugo
	Slavs to his standard were illustrated
	in his own feeling toward Supilo when
	he summed up for the defence of that
	leader in the Friedjung trial with the
	words,
	"For him I would lay both my hands
	in the fire."
	j While a member of the Reichsrat,
	! Masaryk went far toward bringing the
	j representatives of the oppressed peo
	! pies in that body into agreement of
	action. His success is indicated by
	! the difficulties which the Austrian gov
	I ernment encountered when it convened
	the body after three years of war,
	only to dissolve it again recently in
	the hope of saving the Hapsburgs and
	the government from ignominy and
	i revolution.
	I
	Known By the
	| Enemies He Has
	Count Czernin, in the course of hii
	last speech in Vienna, made "the
	wretched and contemptible Masaryk'
	responsible for the failure of Austrii
	to conclude a "strong" peace. Oi
	j April 13 a delegation of twenty-thre<
	? Jugo-Slav deputies and four womei
	j went to Prague to protest against Coun
	Czernin's attacks on the Czechs an
	Masaryk. One of them, Pavelich b;
	name, said, "Seventy years ago, in 184S
	we Serbs, Croats and Slovenes came t
	Prague in order to save Austria. Tc
	day we come to save ourselves. Th
	glove which Czernin threw at th
	Czechs is also a challenge to us, an
	more firmly than ever we shall stan
	together until victory is won."
	Masaryk was one of the first men t
	warn Allied statesmen of the dangei
	of the Pan-German plan of Mittelei
	i ropa and to perceive in the dissolutir
	of Austria-Hungary and the establisl
	I ment in the place of the Dual Moi
	i archy of independent states the on
	! practical way of checking the Pa:
	| German aspirations in Central ar
	; Eastern Europe.
	His uncompromising attitude towa
	? the hopeless kind of government pr
	i vided by the Hapsburgs and their toe
	, led him to leave Austria, withdraw in
	| exile and range himself on the si

	I MUST leave it to pens abler than
	mine to deal with strategy, to
	give an expert account of the
	scenes of those encounters which have
	ravaged France during the Great War.
	I merely wish to speak of places?now
	become historical?as I remember them
	before the war, of the people with
	whom I was brought in contact dur?
	ing my wanderings in the land of my
	birth, from north to south and east to
	west.
	At times it will seem like a revival
	of ancient things, of an old France,
	though scarcely four years divide us
	from that first terrible invasion of
	August and September, 1914, when the
	wild hordes, carrying in their trail
	death and destruction, made a wilder
	! ness of those departments which were
	I once the glory of France. What great
	! book might not be written also of
	| those countrysides, demolished by
	i bombs, now full of troops, where the
	: star-spangled flag of America waves
	i beside the tricolor.
	Pious Hands
	Attend Them
	To-day spring sheds its flowers on
	some of those desolate plains; they
	spring up on the hillside where one
	grave follows another, battered by
	wind and rain now for nearly four
	years-?for one of the fiercest on?
	slaughts, which has gone on almost
	without interruption until now, was
	made in the Vosges. Vet some of the
	rough wooden crosses- it seems al?
	most a miracle?havo still hanging on
	their rude arms and k?pis of the poilus
	who rest there. Pious hands, who
	look after the graves and bring flow?
	ers, do not disturb them. There the
	children of France lie until the great
	day of awakening, and beside them
	some of the finest sons of America,
	who were the first to answer France's
	call for help. They nobly fulfilled
	their mission and, cradled by the soft i
	starlit nights of the land for which
	they died, its earth weighs lightly on i
	their last resting place.
	Perhaps the attack was wildest here,
	because Germany felt less secure in
	Lorraine than it did in Alsace, which,
	with the exception of Belfort and its
	territories, forms in its entirety part
	of the Reichslaender. As to Lorraine,
	France, by the -Treaty of Frankfort
	on-Main in 1871, surrendered only part ;
	of the department of the Meurthe and
	that of the Moselle. What remains
	forms to-day the department of
	Meurthe and Moselle, with Nancy as '
	capital. In any case, a tremendous ;
	? German effort was put forth against
	j Nancy, Pon't-?-Mousson and the poor
	little village of Amanee.
	They Tried to Join
	The Mother Country
	On July 80, 1914, and the succeeding
	days, youths and men?even those who
	had been through the campaign of:
	1870-'71 -- endeavored to cross the
	I frontier and enlist in France. The
	i enthusiasm of those first hours was in?
	describable. With that faith which
	moves mountains, they saw themselves
	already united to the great mother
	family. In two days only old men,
	women and children were left, for ?
	I those who were too late to escape hael
	! to serve in the German army, and had
	1 also gone.
	Yet even many of these were true to .
	Franco, as far as in them lay. A story :
	is told of a young Lorraine recruit,
	whose French-born mother had brought I
	him up in the secret love for her I
	patrie. He was swept into the Ger
	man army and sent to fight in the
	North of France, whence he wrote
	to the mother whose influence was the
	greatest power in his life, as it is in
	that of most Frenchmen: "Dear
	mother?As I promised you, I have not
	taken the life of a single Frenchman,
	and will never do so." Across the
	pencil-scrawled sheet was written:
	"Madame?Your son was shot at dawn .
	as a traitor."
	Tru,c to tradition, which runs like a
	thread of gold through our history,
	the French women have done their
	duty well all through the war, though,
	of course, in the departments which are
	not invaded, they have suffered less
	materially. But for valiance, endur?
	ance and stoic courage, none can be
	compared with the women of the de
	nartments of the Vosges, Meuse,
	Meurthe and Moselle, who are called
	collectively Lorraines, or sometimes
	Vosgiennes. They are women of great
	purpose and courage, ahiefly due to the
	fact that their country, this eastern
	part of France, has constantly been a
	battlefield. Even in the time of the
	Gauls Borne fought here. On these
	plains it conquered them, then to
	? ether with the subjugated enemies
	ought Attila, whose hordes sheltered
	behind their walls of earth?the fore?
	runner of the present Huns' trench
	tactics.
	They are worthy wives and mothers
	of those heroic Lorraine soldiers who
	bore the brunt of the first shock and
	who, after having brought the hope of
	France into the annexed provinces,
	saved, by their bravery, French Lor?
	raine from a too long occupation by
	the enemy. The mothers had gone
	through the horrors of the defeats in
	1870-1871, the daughters had been
	brought up with the thought that some
	day "the Land of the Empire" would
	come back to the motherland. They
	were not surprised at the war; to those
	on German territory it seemed to
	herald deliverance. Like the fathers,
	brothers, husbands, sweethearts who
	had left, they mobilized themselves to
	shower their hearts' joy and gladness
	in gifts upon the soldiers who came
	so gallantly to the sound of the "Mar?
	seillaise," or the song of the "Sambre
	et Meuse." Nothing was too good, too
	precious for those young heroes who
	took part in the fights which will go
	down to posterity as some of the most
	glorious exploits of the war.
	They had known well, during the
	forty-four years of anguish and de?
	ferred hope, with loving counsel and
	sympathy to keep up the flame of hope
	in the hearts of their men. Any sacri?
	fice now seemed as naught to them
	Flowers, ?wine, chocolate, the choicest
	fruit, all vhey cherished, all they pos?
	sessed, thtyy brought, it to our petit?
	soldats, a?, they passed along the road
	The heroic dash in German territorj
	was broken at Morhange, and darkei
	days even than those which went be
	fore have come to Lorraine. But theii
	women have not lost faith. Few o:
	our soldiers who ware in that openinj
	campaign will come back, but those
	who do will always remember the un
	speakablc joy they brought to the peo

	hours of mad exultation. There ar<
	sons, fathers, brothers, husbands wh<

	that she shall be delivered.
	Like Jeanne d'Arc, they feel that I
	patrie is worthy of all their love and
	devotion. They have known the woes
	of our army retreating, and hopes
	which promised immediate realization
	dashed to the ground. But they do not
	lose heart for that. Like the maiden,
	they have by nature that happy com?
	bination of character which allows
	them to cope with deferred hopes. They
	are full of enthusiasm and yet have
	common sense?that most useful qual?
	ity. Audacious at times, and thus ablo
	to encounter danger, they can be most
	witty, yet are prudent in giving their
	opinion.
	The soil of the Lorraine is naturally
	barren and unproductive, yet, thanks
	to the industry of its inhabitants, it
	has grown to be fruitful. Now that
	they ire alone the women have brave?
	ly taken up the task, T'oere are many
	children in Lorraine. They are help?
	ing their mothers to sow, even to
	plough, and I am tolei that not merely
	their hands, but their hearts are in
	the task, hearts and souls of those va?
	liant Lorraines.
	Ready for Emergencies
	and Rich With Hope
	Wherever the shower of shTapne
	allows it munition factories hav
	sprung up. In these the women o:
	Lorraine work incessantly, and theii
	output, a.s figures show, is compara
	tively larger than anywhere else. I
	always comes back to the one idea

	are so valiant and true. So cheerful
	alsol So I knew them, hiding unde
	a smile and a brave word their disap
	pointments, great and small; so I fee
	sure they are to-day ready for an;

	It often has seemed to me that some
	thing of the spirit of Jeanne d'An
	their great countrywoman, of the sim
	pie, brave, pious young girl, lives i
	them. Knowing that a task was sc
	before her, which it was her duty t
	accomplish, even though it cost he
	lif?, so she lived and moved among th
	Lorraine women of her time. To-da
	the virtues of her humbler sisters at

	In order to intimidate him the Aus?
	trian authorities placed his wife under
	police surveillance? and his daughter,
	Alice, in prison. She was afterward re?
	leased through the efforte of a number
	of American women's societies. She was
	well known in Chicago, where she had
	been a settlement worker.
	He is the author of a number of
	books and many pamphlets as well as
	the founder of the Czech Progressive
	party. Among his hooks are?. "Suicide
	a3 a Pathological Symptom of Modern
	Civilization." "The Social Question."
	"The Sociological and Philosophical
	Basis of Marxism." "The System of
	Realism," "The Czech Question," and
	"Russia and Europe." His w.de knowl?
	edge of Russia will make him a valu?
	able to aid the Allies in meeting the
	i situation now presented in that coun
	itr?
	The closing words of Masaryk*s Car
	! negie Hall speech are the key to his
	! life. For him it is humanity, the soul,
	which counts. He is first of all an
	ethical teacher. His sincerity of pur?
	pose, his soundness of thought, his in?
	sistence upon facing facts, his willing?
	ness to give his all for those causes
	which he adopts whether they are popu?
	lar or not, and his natural capacity as
	a leader have combined to make him
	! the idol of his fellow countrymen and
	the inspiration and rallying point of
	all tho oppressed peoples of Austria
	Hungary.
	i To sum up, Masaryk is a statesman
	whose strength lies in moral and in?
	tellectual eiualities. He is largely the
	i author and embodiment of the nev,
	Slavism. He personifies the liberal
	democratic spirit which has replac?e
	; the old Slav spirit of imperialism. The
	. last vestige of the latter disappearee
	< when the Romanoff dynasty was over
	! thrown. The new Slavism has no im
	: perialistic aims, thanks to Masaryk ane
	! his followers. They fight for the lib
	? erty of Eastern Europe.
	Estimating the
	Chances of Success
	What are the chances of success o:
	: a revolutionary movement in Austria
	Hungary? Andre Ch?radame, an au
	thority on this subject, in an article it
	: the June "Atlantic Monthly," point:
	out that there is a tremendous laten
	i and potent hatred of Pan-German;
	\ among millions of peoples include*
	! within the confines of the Central Em
	pires available for revolutionary ob
	, jects. It only awaits the call to giv
	I it life and vigor. He believes it to b
	? a decisive factor in the war. He says
	"The Allies could systematicall;
	arm, by the aerial route, a part of th
	' 14,000,000 anti-Pan-Germans, non-mob
	ilized, in Central Germany, and thu
	bring about an insurrection in the re
	gions traversed by the vital strategi
	communications 01 Pan-Germany. Sec
	ondly, they could, by means of suci
	; insurrections, bring about a state o
	affairs, both moral and matt-rial, whic
	would enable the 8,000,000 troops em
	bodied against their will in the Ger
	man armies to revolt in their turn.
	"Assuming this form of strategy t
	be adopted, the 19.000,000 Germans an
	pro-Germans would have to face th
	; hostile action, active or passive, o
	20,000,000 Allied troops, 8,000,000 o
	their own troops in revolt or on stri-k
	and 14,000,000 possible insurgent civ
	ilians, or 42,000,000 in all.
	"If the Germans had been in ou
	1 place, would they not long ago hav
	made use of the anti-German element
	in Pan-Germany, considering that i
	Russia they have derived the enormou
	. profit that we all know from element
	favorable to their cause, although the
	were much less numerous than thos
	: utilizable by the Allies? Under thes
	conditions can the latter refuse t
	adopt, at last, the Btrategy of the pe
	. litical sciences?
	"Far from working to the prejudic
	of the Western front, it would wor
	: altogether to its advantage; for notl
	ing could afford greater relief to tfc
	Allied troops from the terrible pr?s!
	| ure that they are having te) withstan
	! on that front than an uprising, sciei
	: tirlcally organized, for the liberatio
	j of Central Europe."
	Masaryk's Task
	In America
	Professor Masaryk, as president I
	what is practically the provisional go
	ernment of the Czecho-Slovak nat?o
	is in this country with live objective
	The first is that of securing the pe
	mission of the Allied governmenta
	transport a Czecho-Slovak army nur
	ing between 50,000 and 100,000 m?
	across Asia and America to Franc
	where it can fight with the Allies,
	is known as the "Army of Victory i
	Death," and was organized by D
	Masaryk from among the large nur
	bers of Czecho-Slovaks who had escpai
	from the Austrian army to Russi
	Since the conclusion of peace by tl
	Bolsheviki the presence of this army
	Russia is superfluous, as it cannot bs
	tie with the Austro-Gerraan fore
	alone.
	His second task is that of strengt
	ening and inspiring the Ciecho-Slova
	in this country. They are already we
	organized for the purpone of financial
	supporting the movement, and ai
	sencling volunteers to Europe. Th

	the Czecho-Slovak National Council,
	has been elected president of the
	Czecho-Slovak republic. News of his

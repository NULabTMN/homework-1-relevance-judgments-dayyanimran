		<text>PASTORS CANT COMPETE WITH
	CHARLEY CHAPLIN
	Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
	Chaplin" sermons were called "im
	possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
	Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
	fore the Woman's Board of Missions
	of the Interior, which closed here to
	day. "There has been much talk about
	making sermons interesting," said
	the speaker. "We never can make
	sermons as interesting as melo
	dramas or prayer meetings as amus
	ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
	were meant to be so.
	"If a heathen dropped into New
	York and saw a church with a seating
	capacity of 1,500, attended by about
	200 on Sunday and dark six days a
	week, he would never go back with
	the impression that the United States
	was a Christian nation."</text>

	<text>PETER'S /g^p'
	_ IFFLE
	Charlie Chaplin is going
	to get $87 0,000 this year for
	making a fool of himself.
	And just think of the num
	ber of would-be ball tossers
	who do the same thing for
	nothing every training sea
	son.
	Mills, Oh Mills! You're quite
	contrary,
	Won't 'low boxing here no mo';
	Why not let the square guys
	try it,
	Just to make the other kind
	■ore?
	You might put a stop to prize
	fight grafting,
	Allow the fans to see good
	sport;
	Tell the duo in the tower
	They must sail clean from this
	port.
	Poetry bubbles from our
	lips Just like aen.ua from thee
	Broadway fountain.RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
	Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
	actor in the world, is appearing
	at the Melbourne and Liberty to
	day in the same picture, "His
	First Vacation.'' Never before
	has the same actor appeared in
	the same picture at two Tacoma
	movies at the same time.
	It is an evidence of the keen
	rivalry between movie men. The
	Melbourne had signed the film
	for next week. The Liberty, how
	ever, obtained the same picture
	for the latter half of this week.
	Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
	bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
	order for his film yesterday when
	he heard of the Libertys' move,
	and obtained his copy of tlie film
	by express yesterday. He put it
	on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-
	Tlie picture remains at both
	houses until tomorrow night.
	CHAPLIN AT
	LIBERTY
	The old favrolte — Charlie
	Chaplin—who has returned to
	the IJberty.
	Movie fans who see Charlie
	Chaplin this week at the Liberty
	will not only see the world's
	greatest comedian in action, after
	a long vacation, but will witness
	the work of a man who gets
	$670,000 a year for being foolish.
	Chaplin recently signed with Mu
	tual at this price. His Liberty
	film, "His First Vacation," is
	added to the regular bill of "The
	Innocence of Ruth,' a clever
	;crook drama.

	In view of tlie fact that Ta

	the excellent and instructive film

		<text>PASTORS CANT COMPETE WITH
	CHARLEY CHAPLIN
	Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
	Chaplin" sermons were called "im
	possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
	Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
	fore the Woman's Board of Missions
	of the Interior, which closed here to
	day. "There has been much talk about
	making sermons interesting," said
	the speaker. "We never can make
	sermons as interesting as melo
	dramas or prayer meetings as amus
	ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
	were meant to be so.
	"If a heathen dropped into New
	York and saw a church with a seating
	capacity of 1,500, attended by about
	200 on Sunday and dark six days a
	week, he would never go back with
	the impression that the United States
	was a Christian nation."</text>

	_ IFFLE
	Charlie Chaplin is going
	to get $87 0,000 this year for
	making a fool of himself.
	And just think of the num
	ber of would-be ball tossers
	who do the same thing for
	nothing every training sea
	son.
	Mills, Oh Mills! You're quite
	contrary,
	Won't 'low boxing here no mo';
	Why not let the square guys
	try it,
	Just to make the other kind
	■ore?
	You might put a stop to prize
	fight grafting,
	Allow the fans to see good
	sport;
	Tell the duo in the tower
	They must sail clean from this
	port.
	Poetry bubbles from our
	lips Just like aen.ua from thee
	Broadway fountain.RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
	Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
	actor in the world, is appearing
	at the Melbourne and Liberty to
	day in the same picture, "His
	First Vacation.'' Never before
	has the same actor appeared in
	the same picture at two Tacoma
	movies at the same time.
	It is an evidence of the keen
	rivalry between movie men. The
	Melbourne had signed the film
	for next week. The Liberty, how
	ever, obtained the same picture
	for the latter half of this week.
	Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
	bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
	order for his film yesterday when
	he heard of the Libertys' move,
	and obtained his copy of tlie film
	by express yesterday. He put it
	on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-
	Tlie picture remains at both
	houses until tomorrow night.
	CHAPLIN AT
	LIBERTY
	The old favrolte — Charlie
	Chaplin—who has returned to
	the IJberty.
	Movie fans who see Charlie
	Chaplin this week at the Liberty
	will not only see the world's
	greatest comedian in action, after
	a long vacation, but will witness
	the work of a man who gets
	$670,000 a year for being foolish.
	Chaplin recently signed with Mu
	tual at this price. His Liberty
	film, "His First Vacation," is
	added to the regular bill of "The
	Innocence of Ruth,' a clever
	;crook drama.

        Charlie Chaplin the real one may
        remain in Honolulu for a short time,
        but Charlie Chaplin the reel one is
        almost a permanent fixture. Provided
        the management of the Hawaii thea
        ter can s'o arrange, C. C. will be a
        perpetual attraction.
        There is little difference with C. C.
        as to the title of his attractions. Just
        so long as the leading comedian of
        the screen is in the billing Honolulu
        and every other city in the world will
        turn out almost en masse. i ne cur
        rent Chaplin attraction at the Hawaii
        happens to be entitled "The foreman,"
        and the title is a good one as it is
        an excuse for Chaplin himself to ap- j
        near for a couple of reels of laugh J
        production. As is customary with
        Chaplin's films there is nothing to it -
        but laughter, although that commo

        CHARLIE CHAPLIN, AND
        SAILS AWAY FOR HIL0
        Boyishly beaming with satisfaction
        at the great crowd present, Charlie
        Chaplin reeled up the gangway or the
        Mauna Kea Saturday afternoon before
        departing for his visit to the volcano.

        the many children present could not
        be convinced that their screen idol
        had really come to life in Honolulu
        until the comedian twisted his ears,
        wrinkled his face and let his feet per
        form. Then there was a chorus of
        childish voices shouting, "bee Char

        Cliarlie had scarcely boarded the
        steamer until lfe and Demosthenes
        Lycurgus had established an entente
        and posed with arms locked for a
        squad of amateur photographers. Due
        to "Monty's" plentiful proiwrtions
        there was grave danger of the Vol
        cano hotel manager "hogging the
        camera," until Charlie was placed on
        the weather, or camera, side.
        As the Mauna Kea pulled into thqi
        stream, the screen comedian waved
        a red bouquet, tiped his white flan
        nel hat, shuffled three dance step3,
        did a" donkey" with his cars, smiled
        his Roosevelt smile, teeth and all,

        Photographers camped on his trail
        and snapped him riding tho sivf

        tho hula girls and even flirting with
        Polo, tho Goddess of Fire, on the
        odgo of tho Volcano at Kllauoa.
        It Is expected that ns soon as his
        contracts permit ho will bring over
        a company and bo filmod with an
        Hawaiian setting which will bo uni

        they returned to tho mainland, Oc
        tober 17, tired, but happy.
        Charlie Chaplin, movlo king, small

        Capturing Charlie Chaplin
        By Harriette Underhill
        Once upon a time we did not love
        Charlie Chaplin. It was not so long
        ago, either?not more than two years?
        and it was when all movie houses re?
        leasing his pictures had those horrible
        wooden effigies of him in the lobby.
        This may have helped to prejudice us.
        At any rate, we used to glory in the
        story of the nice old lady who went tim?
        idly up to the box office and said: "Ex?
        cuse me, "but is Charlie Chaplin's pict?
        ure showing here?" "Yes, ?madam," re?
        plied the box office man. "Going on at
        2 o'clock." "Thank you," replies the
        n. o. 1. "Then I won't go in." We al?
        ways quoted that nice old lady and
        never felt that we were really under?
        stood unless we could find some one to
        talk to who didn't like Charlie, either.
        This was not so difficult at first, but
        we felt that we were rapidly losing our
        very best supporters, and hardly a day
        passed but some one of them went over
        to the pro-Charlies. Then along came
        Heywood Broun, "our favorite dramatic
        critic," saying that Charlie Chaplin was
        screamingly funny and an artist. We
        began to weaken.
        First we went to see a Chaplin pict?
        ure with an unbiassed mind. Then we
        went to see another one voluntarily,
        and then we fell to wondering how long
        we must wait for the next to be re?
        leased.
        Four days ago we saw Charlie Chap?
        lin talking to a man in front of Clar
        idge'8, and we became incoherent with
        excitement. It was the first time we
        ever had seen him off the screen, and
        we were immediately stricken with in
        terviewitis. Stage and screen persons
        have come to be merely subjects. They
        are good, bad or indifferent?mostly in?
        different?but Charlie was a prize not
        to bo ignored.
        The fact that he was avoiding pub?
        licity and had refused to see all inter?
        viewers made the thing so much more
        interesting. The most he could do
        would be to deny his identity and say:
        "Madam, how daro you! I am not that
        sort of person." But fortunately his
        countenance was not as inscrutable as
        that of the hotel clerk up at the Ritz,
        where Charlie has his modest little
        three rooms and five baths. But more
        of that hotel clerk later.
        At any rate, we decided to sacrifice
        everything on the altar of duty, so we
        went straight up to the great and only
        Charles and just as we were about to
        pluck him by the sleeve and say, "Ex?
        cuse me, Mr. Chaplin, I'm the person
        who has been writing such nice things
        about you," we discovered ?hat the
        man he. was talking to was the man
        who writes the second best movie re?
        views in town.
        Of course, even with a proper intro?
        duction it was a bit disconcerting ?to
        meet your screen idol so suddenly,
        without his shoes or his cane or his
        hat, and yet we knew him immediately.
        Wo apologized for the interruption,
        mentally deciding that wild horses
        couldn't drag us away until we had had
        a chance to find out just how Charlie
        Chaplin talked, how he thought, how
        he dressed and how he looked.
        He talks humorously, he thinks se?
        riously, he dresses quietly and he
        looks handsome. He has the whitest
        teeth we ever saw, the bluest eyes and
        the blackest eyelashes. "How did you
        know me?" inquired Mr. Chaplin
        naively. "Why, you look just like your
        pictures," wo answered truthfully.
        "Not my pictures on the screen, I
        hope?" said Charlie. "Oh, no," said
        we. "But, you know, occasionally one
        does see a photograph of you in a
        magazine." "Oh, I see," said Charlie.
        "Such is fame." And then we said
        pleadingly, "Won't you please let us
        interview you?" To which he replied:
        "You know, I haven't seen a person
        nor talked to any one, but if you'll
        promise not to say anything about my
        work for the government, why?all
        right."
        He looked terribly suspicious. Just
        as though we were not taking more of
        a chance than he was. Hadn't we seen
        him drop ice cream down a lady's neck
        and get her involved in a revolving
        door and trip her up with his cane?
        And how could we tell what moment
        he might pull a dog out of his. trousers
        pocket or drop an egg out of his hat on
        our new suit?
        But he told us that he never again
        would pull a dog out of his trousers
        pocket, because Mutt, who co-starred
        with his master in "A Dog's Life," is
        dead, and no other ever shall take his
        place. When Charlie came East he
        left Mutt behind, and to, being only a
        dog, Mutt refused to forget his beloved
        friend. He starved himself to death
        and was buried on the 29th of April.
        "Every one told Mutt that I would
        Burely return, but perhaps he didn't
        understand, or perhaps he didr?'t be?
        lieve them. At any rate, he never would
        ] eat after the last time I fed him, and
        the inscription on his tombston^ reads:
        'Mutt, died April 29?a broken heart.'"
        We talked to Mr. Chaplin for an
        hour, and then he suddenly remem?
        bered that he had to go out and make
        a speech on the subject which we
        promised not to mention. And he told
        us about how much better he likes the
        West than he does the East, and ad?
        mitted that he could play the 'cello
        and the violin and the piano, and thst
        he had worked for two-and-six a week
        in London, and that he didn't know
        why people laughed at him, and how
        he first walked his famous walk. The
        other things which we learned about
        Chaplin are probably known to every
        one who knows Charlie.</text>

	It' Grandmother's Recipe to
	Bring Back Color and
	Lustre to Hair.
	TffVbeautlfuJ, even ihnde of rlark,
	glossy Itair can only be had by brew
	ing a mixture of Sage Tea and Sul
	phur. Your batr is your charm. It
	makes or mars the face. When it
	fades, turns gray or streaked, just an
	application or two of Sage and Sul
	phur enhance ill appearance a hun
	dredfold. Don't bother to prepare the mix
	ture; you can get this famous old
	recine imnroved by the addition nf
	other ingredients at a small cost, all
	ready for use. It is called Wyrtlrs
	ige and Sulphur Compound. This
	can always be depended upon to bring
	back the natural color and lustre of
	your hair.
	Everybody uses "WyethV Sage nnd
	Sulphur Compound now because it
	darkens so naturally and evenly that
	nobody can tell it has been applied.
	You simply dampen a sponge or soft
	brush with it and draw this through
	the hair, taking one small strand at a
	time; by morning the gray hair has
	disappeared, and after another appli
	cation it becomes beautifully dark and
	appears glossy and lustrous. This
	ready-to-use preparation is a delightful

	Charlie Chaplin in a Care-Free, Gay S
	having Just the Way He Did Not,
	Says, So Far as She Was Conce
	NO recent case of broken romance and
	once fond hearts estranged has created
	such Interest as the suit for
	y divorce by Mrs. Charlie Chaplin against
	her husband, the world famous funny man
	of the motion pictures. The charges
	i brought by Mrs. Chaplin are "mental cruelty"
	and failure of her husband to provide
	for her. /
	Among the millions whom Charlie Chaplin
	has made laugh there l'"ve probably
	been msnv. wl'o hove thou?V*. how carefree
	and amusing the lot of the woman
	vas his wire. No wcma'.i, It would
	could ever have the toluss or be
	'ig but cheerful with so m.rthi~
	a companion. Yet strangely
	rre are no sadder, more posai'?
	than the professional humorni
	to use up all their store of

	"u. Charlie Chnnlln w.13 no exI?

	months in housekeeping expenses, although
	during that time Mrs. Chaplin herself
	was earning $1,000 a week.
	By Mr*. Charlie Chaplin
	(In an interview) <
	I AM quite ready to admit that my marriage
	to Charlie Chaplin was a mistake.
	It was a mistake on his part, because
	he is a genius, and geniuses should not
	I knarry. He would better be free and remain
	free, for he will make any 'woman he
	marries miserable, I know. J
	I We have been married for three years.
	Tor two of those years we lived under the1
	! same roof, more or less. That Is, if greeting
	a husband after long disappearances
	might be said to be living under t^e same
	L [roof with him.
	I If lying awake, weeping and wondering
	where your husband is, until 4 or 6 o'clock
	in the morning can really be called living.
	1 If wrangling over every bill that comes
	i in can be called Mving.
	If living on the scale of an income of
	$250 a week, when your husban<\ earns
	$13,000 a week, can be called living.
	If having your wardrobe censored and a
	standard of two or three dresses and one
	hat established may be considered an existence.
	If being told to Keep your head down
	to that no man will'see your face is living. .
	Tf hearing that meat and potatoes and
	i 'rtdlng are enough for a meal and that
	i ?? cream and salads are silly and useless
	iiMlv stands for proper living.
	V being constantly accused of flirting by
	n i'*n who Is causelessly Jealous Is living.
	*!', this and more I endured?and for
	; v? vn months. That Is the reason I hesit?te
	?o .'ay that we lived under the same
	, f. Tt wasn't living. It was perdition
	f- ?.
	U lias been said that a comedian Is only
	! i ,iy in public, I believe It. In fact, 1
	,< .W It. Chsrlle Chaplin, who has made
	ruil'lons laugh, only caused me tears.
	So It was better that we should separate,
	'letter that there be a divorce. 1 have
	KPsn htm since my suit for divorce began.
	We met in the office of my lawyer in L-os
	When we parted he said: "Mildred, you
	are right I should never have married.
	I know It now. Yon probably will marry
	soon. If rou do I hope you will be happy.
	I shall never marry again " And we
	looked at each other sadly?a funny man
	and his wife.
	That the public may not be misled by
	strange, false rumors I will tell for once
	nnrt finally, unless I tell It In court, the

	film specialty is tears, "sob stuff." And
	the news of the marriage 'was soon follow

	groom was not getting on very well with
	the tearful bride.
	Nobody seemed to know jti~t what was
	the matter but in due time Mrs. Chaplin
	admitted that she and her husband had
	separated. Then followed several state
	ments from Mrs. C'haplin but no comments
	came ifom Mr. Chaplin.
	At last the 'matrimonial troubles drifted
	into the Los Angeles courts. Mrs. (Chap

	A.-Well, when we %rere married Mr.
	Chaplin told me he wanted me to break
	the contract with the Pniversal, because
	he did not want me iorking with them.
	So, when I was in the hbspital, after I was
	first taken ill, I sent a written notice that
	I would not be with them any more and I
	was under age. My lawyer told me we
	could break the contract. Then, in Feb
	ruary. when I came back from Mt. Lowe.
	they had been sendjag me my check each
	-:eek, and I had been sending them back
	and they would return them again, but I
	had not cashed any. In February a friend
	of mine, Miss Bweet, asked me to go to
	New York with her when I came back
	from Mt. Lowe, and Mr. Chaplin had been
	away so long, and when he came back he
	said it would do me good to go to New
	York, so I wentt with her. But he wouldn't
	give me but $150.'and when I got East r
	bought a lot of baby clothes ad some baby
	furniture and a few other things, and I did
	not have enough money and I wired for
	more money. But he would not send me
	any more, so I wired mother to please
	ash one of my checks.
	Q.--That 'was the check that would re
	a-dirm your contract irith the Universal
	-eople, which he advised you to break?
	A-Yes, sir.
	Q.-Did you advise him with reference
	to your circumstances?
	A-Yes.
	Q.-DId you advise him that you expect
	ed to purchase some furniture for the ex
	pected child?
	A-Yes, sir.
	Q.-And he declined to send you any
	money at all?
	A.-Yes.
	Q.-And he was making apozimately
	16,000 or I7,000 a month at that time?
	A.-More than that.
	Q.-You mentioned the furniture. You
	say there was an arrangement made about
	snme turniture for the baby's room?
	A.-BDefore I went East Mr. Chaplin said
	Icould get a set of furniture for my room
	un in our home, because it was very dark.
	Q.-That was the room in which you
	were to be confined?
	A.-Yes, sir; my own roem. So. ?

	got back from he . York the room was all
	=urnished in thE aew furniture, ad he
	took me up to see it, and I was very happy
	about it aid he seemed to be quite pleased.
	but when the bfll came he refused to pay
	it. He said it was too expeasive and tat
	Ishould send it back.

	Famous Movie Comedian says
	London He Knew as Boy
	Does Not Exist Now
	BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN
	LONDON, Oct. 1. I always figure
	America under the symbol of youth
	vigorous, aggressive, full of hope and
	pen. courageous, and with the sun
	light of the morning shining in its
	eyes.
	I find England more like a serene
	old age mellowed by time, softened
	ly suffering, wise from long experi
	ence and with the. afterglow of the
	westering sun in its eyes.
	America, like all youth, has a core
	of hardness in its heart.
	England, like all mellowed old age
	has a core of tenderness in its heart.
	I should say America for work,
	England for thoughtful contempla
	tion and dreams. ,
	Of course, I know England is one of
	the mightiest nations in the world;
	that its hardy sons rule an empire;
	that they sail all seas and traffic In
	all markets. But I am merely trying
	to give my own impressions, to tell
	how the two countries 'affect me.
	I don't think I could do much work
	in England. Everything Is so finish
	ed, so settled, so restful that it would
	simply absorb' me.
	America Is Restless
	nut there Is in America a feeling of
	the unfinished, of restlessness that
	ius. makes one want to get up and do
	thjngs. That is why I am going back
	In a few weeks.
	It's all very nice to say that Chap
	lin brings laughter to men, but the
	truth is that Chaplin is working for
	his bread and cheese just like the
	rest of you. There is not much fun
	jn loafing too long.
	' I have been rediscovering England
	for myself aiyl contrasting my Im
	pressions of America and also with
	my memeories of the England I knew
	as a boy.
	' I came to America when I was 18
	und In the past 14 years have only
	been back home once. .
	My best experience has been to ram
	ble around the streets in the poor
	sections of London that I 'used
	know. I found in the mean streets
	something very lovely, something spir
	itunl. I nian as regards the people.
	There they were, living in misera
	ble ( tenements, their faces thin and
	pinehed from poor food, and yet there
	w something very beautiful in their
	eye.
	I. have never seen anything sweeter
	than the expression in the face of a
	girl out walking with her coster Tcrer.
	I began to understand how these
	poor people had suffered during the
	long years of the war and how thev
	had found the pluck to do it. and 1
	saw the mak rit had left on them. It
	was saddening as well as beautiful to
	get these -revelations.
	Had "Emotional Jag"
	Then I had an emotional jag. I
	prowled these poor streets in search
	or a wistful little bov I used to know
	a little, ill-dressed, rather fright
	ened Charlie Chaplin.
	Somehow. I couldn't quite catch up
	with him. The streets all seemed nar
	rower to me than they did to that
	little chap, and the crowds not quite
	so big and bustling, and the policemen
	not quite so terrifying.

	But I did see something we haven't
	got in America. eaw the mark Iof
	class distinction. The population In
	England Is really subdivided into real
	classes and castes. And being a very
	I old civilization and a very crowded
	country, it is hard for a man to get
	ou of his class.
	We have none of that in America.
	The workman of today still has the
	chance to be the captain of, industry
	of tomorrow. Why, the poor editor of
	yesterday is the president of today!
	America" is still in thd construction
	stage. She is not finished. That i
	why the builders, who are at work on
	the structure today, should be so very
	careful.
	It seems to me, looking back
	across the waters and across time,
	that America Is in a very critical pe
	riod. 1
	Finance is once, more in danger of
	falling into the 1 bands of the few we
	always call "Wall Street."
	And finance is adapting a taa Intol
	erant attitude toward labor. Labor
	should not be -asked to do all the giv
	ing un. Finance should give up a lit
	tle, also."
	There is a danger that if there is
	too much clash, a class feeling will
	develon which would be entirely un
	American. Too Much Organization
	I think "another danger to America
	is the number 'of organizations which
	are growing up which are anti-some-bodyq,
	anti-some religion or race or
	creed or free expression of thought.
	America can learn a lesson in this
	regard from old England. There is
	far greater personal liberty and far
	greater iibertv of speech in England
	than in America. .
	Since havle been over here I have
	seen it stated that I am a deep reader
	and that I am a Socialist. I would
	like to deny both statements. I am
	not a highbrow. I don't pretend to
	be. My only pretension is to be an
	rtist. I don't mix in, politics. And
	I am nol immersed in economic litera
	tu. " . " .. i
	I am neither, a Socialist 'nor a par
	lor Bolshevik. But I believe with all
	mv heart in social reform. I believe
	very strongly in municipal ownership
	of public utilities. I believe in the
	nationalization of the railways and
	probably of coai mines. ,

	i .5 there is this hidden scamp hero with
	whom Chaplin identifies himself and
	with whom the world of respectabilities
	??nd conventionalities is in conflict.
	Chaplin expresses for us an imaginary

	it by resolving it into a joke.

	bowl this secret and reveals it in
	Iiiis hook.
	Gar!...' Chaplin's book is from the
	psychological angle a remarkable hu?
	man document, greatly because of this
	revelation. It explains the appeal of
	this poor little feeble creature on the
	outglde of the great big world. To the
	reade?r unversed in psychology the
	outstanding features of the book are
	likely to be the triumphant return of
	Charlie Chaplin to the land of his birth
	his meetings with the great in poli?
	tics and letters his sympathy for the
	unfortunate his intimate confessions
	of his likes and dislikes. However, the
	real revelation lies in Charlie's visits
	to the haunts of his childhood.
	Trio whole tone of the book is that
	of a half lonely ?'dventurer visiting the
	scene:; of his early 1 i fr. reacting with
	genuine sympathy to every situation.
	We learn of Chaplin's early experi?
	ence as a little ragged urchin. On top
	of that, experience has been imposed
	this magical thing- for his succ?s?? has
	been like an Arabian Nights fantasy?
	and 1 doubt if he has ever quite real?
	ized tha' ?t vvas he who has had it.
	This little ragged urchin has stayed
	v.ith Chaplin all his life and is the
	main reason for his tremendous hu?
	man appeal.
	? ? ?
	OUR or five years ago ?ome neigh?
	bor child came rushing to me, all
	out of breath. She was all excited, for
	she was going to the Hippodrome to see
	"Charlie Chaplin himself.'' ?
	At thar time "Charlie Chaplin him-'
	self didn't mean any more to me than !
	Charlie in the, movies. But after read?
	ing his book T feel that I do know
	Charlie Chaplin himself. In another
	age. where he would have had to ap
	pear directly in person before his
	audiences, the chances are that the
	personal side of his art would have
	been more evident to the people, who
	are rather inclined to look down on
	the movies, anyhow, and who have re?
	garded Charlie Chaplin merely as a
	comedian who makes lots of money.
	The motion picture ,is a medium of
	expression is a syndicate sort of thing.
	It takes a tremendous amount of per?
	sonality to overcame the?" difficulties.
	] !. ? crowds who have bce'n rooting for
	Chaplin have been psychologically cor?
	rect. 'While he has an enormous popu?
	larity, he doesn't make an appeal to
	the crowd mind, but rather a secret

	What was Chaplin like?
	remember that I paid a large tax
	on my own income. In 1917, for
	instance, it was about 50 per cent.
	Some of the stars were per
	sonally just as fabulous charac
	ters as the fan magazines painted
	them. I was married to one
	Doughs Fairbanks. You could
	almost say that he went through
	life swinging from chandelier to
	chandelier, just as he did in his
	pictures. He wasn’t a show-off
	just naturally a joyous person.
	During our honeymoon abroad,
	we had dinner one night at the
	"Tour d’Argent” in Paris. Like
	every other guest there, I mar
	veled at the great view of Notre
	Dame Cathedral, and Doughs
	seemed impressed, too. He said,
	"You know, Mary. I think I can
	see enough hand-holds to climb
	all the way up that right-hand
	tower.”
	Daredevils Fairbanks and Ford
	One time in California Doughs
	and I visited Henry Ford’s home.
	I was awed by the dour old
	billionaire, but not Doughs. He
	jollied Mr. Ford outrageously and
	the two went out for a stroll
	on the estate. I stayed in the
	drawing room with Mrs. Ford,
	and when it came time to go, I
	went outside to find Doughs. He
	was sitting astride the ridgepole
	of the house, three stories up,
	and Henry Ford was sitting there
	with him, laughing fit to kill.
	When I got Doughs alone, 1
	really lit into him.
	"Perfectly safe,” he protested.
	"I tried the hand-holds twice
	before I let him go up.”
	It certainly was an era of fabu
	lous nonsense! But at least it was
	fun and it was harmless. The fans
	saw to that! A breath of scandal
	that touched a star could ruin
	~jjtSk<RU*r
	him. The standards were so strict
	that they were sometimes grossly .
	unfair: When a famous director,
	William Desmond Taylor was
	mysteriously murdered, Mabel
	Normand’s career was blighted,
	though she had no connection
	with the murder at all she had
	merely been going out with
	Taylor.
	The truth about Charlie
	I mentioned that many of the
	Hollywood stars of yesterday were
	characters born almost of fan
	tasy. But of course many weren’t,
	and surprisingly enough, Charlie
	Chaplin was one of the latter. The
	one question that people ask more
	than any other is: "What was
	Charlie Chaplin like?” The an
	swer: "When Charlie wasn’t act
	ing, he tended to be a bore.”
	Charlie was the star of any
	party as long as he was doing his
	parlor "bits.” But whenever he
	wasn’t performing, he could be
	very tiresome. He was forever
	launching into long lectures on
	dry subjects. One of his obses
	sions was the British monetary
	system and how he proposed to
	reform it.
	But regardless of how one may
	feel about Charlie Chaplin as a
	person, nobody furthered the
	story-book tradition more than he
	did. Wis old silent movies were
	nuuterpierei of make-believe,
	ereryoneoj thorn worth • dozen
	modem triumph* of realism.
	I'm not suggesting that realism
	isn’t good. But I do suggest very
	strongly that if we Americans and
	our entertainment keep on get
	ting any more sophisticated and
	hard-bitten, we might someday
	lose one of the greatest of all
	human arts: the art of believing
	in make-believe. The M

	Says:
	“And the enormous crowds left the theatre with every emotion, from hysterical
	gales of laughter to the stifled sobs of sympathy, completely exhausted.
	“That was the experience of the audience at the New York Strand theatre last night
	who went to the opening of Charlie Chaplin’s new film, ‘The Kid,’ First National’s six
	reels of joy. ‘Six reels of joy’ tells but half of it, for while the comedian has never
	been so mirth-provoking in any previous production, the story which is unfolded con
	tains more real heart-throbs than many a picture that has built up reputations for
	emotional actresses.
	“Charlie is himself, but he has injected himself into a story of heart interest that has
	seldom been equaled. The synopsis of it sounds rather trite, for it starts'with the
	abandonment of her baby by the woman who has been wronged. Charlie finds the
	baby and raises him to boyhood. The typical Chaplinesque methods of raising the
	Kid are responsible lor a good part of the humor with which the piece abounds,
	while his pitiable, whimsical procedure to gain the child’s love dampened many an
	eye. The dramatic climax of the film comes with Chaplin’s losing fight, and the
	Kid’s despair when the law separates them, but this is followed so closely by a bit
	of comedy which, perhaps, is the best of the piece, in which Charlie rescues him
	after a chase over roof tops, that people laugh the lumps right out of their throats.
	“If you love comedy you cannot afford to miss seeing “The Kid,” and if you enjoy
	being held enthralled in the grip of pathos, there is a treat awaiting after you go
	into the theatre where it is showing.”
	The daylight trials of motherhood, and the midnight
	trials of paternity are all for Chaplin in this super
	comedy. He is a good mother to the Kid, and when
	that Kid grows up he surely becomes a good son,
	for Charlie is a wondering glazier, and while the Kid
	goes ahead breaking windows, Charlie is always at
	hand to get the job of mending them. And yet there
	is a sob now and then; you never expected that of
	Charlie, did you.
	If You Love Comedy You Cannot Afford to Miss It.
	If you enjoy being held enthralled in the grip of pathos a treat awaits you</text>

	Cried Pola Negri in Tragic Earnestness.
	SCARCELY two years since Charlie Chaplin
	was divorced from Mildred Harris, is
	wife, and now his new romance wi
	German-Pole film star, Pola Negri, is clou e
	with trouble.
	The Polish nobleman, Count Dombski, has
	heard the news where he happens now to be in
	England and has announced that Pola Negri is
	still his wife and that Charlie Chaplin must face
	him in a duel if he dares to marry Pola Negri.
	It would be a strange sight if the motion
	picture audiences could see the fiery Count
	Dombski rush forward, sword in hand, to make
	the great film comedian answer to him on the
	field of honor. But the threatened duel is hardly
	likely to happen where the movie cameras can photograph it.
	x Charlie Chaplin is very handy with that cane of his. Is it
	possible that Mr. Chaplin would take a humorous view of the
	wild-eyed Polish Count and would give him a lesson in fencing
	with his cane? z ~
	The film audiences have seen Mr. Chaplin wiggle away from
	all sorts of threatening situations and,-again and again, that
	handy cane has tripped up policemen and detectives and big
	bullies. But that was on the screen. What would Charlie do
	rn a real life encounter with Count Dombski and his sharp-edged
	S "°ln the recent news from the interesting lovers Pola Negri
	has sebmed to be rather more demonstrative than Mr. Chaplin.
	The expressions that have come from the comedian have seemed
	to be rather conservative, as if, perhaps, he had some anxieties
	or misgivings in the back of his nead. Has Charlie Chaplin re
	ceived a warning that he will be held to account on the field of
	honor if he takes Pola Negri as a bride?
	Pola Negri is a very attractive woman, and it is not surpris
	ing that a man who was lucky enough to once possess her would
	fight valiantly not to lose her. Very little has been revealed as
	to the exact facts of Pola Negri’s marriage to Count Dombski, or
	just when, where, and under what circumstances the divorce
	was secured which Pola Negri relies upon to make it possible
	for her to marry Charlie Chaplin.
	But the interview quoted above with Count, Dombski was
	secured by a British newspaper, and if Count Dombski makeg
	good his threat to come to America and require an accounting
	at the hands of Charlie Chaplin, a very interesting situation
	will develop.
	Whether Count Dombski is now cn his way to America to
	settle things with the film comedian and his runaway wife has
	not been announced. It is possible that Count Dombski may
	be arranging his affairs in a leisurely manner and may not
	arrive until after the marriage takes place.
	Whatever Count Dombski may be planning to do, there is

	little doubt that the Polish nobleman is a man of vigorous per
	sonality and violent manner. He is an excellent swordsman and
	a very good shot with the pistol.
	Pola Negri herself, in telling of her romance and carriage
	to Count Dombski, explains that he was so violently opposed to
	having his wife continue working in the studios that he forbade
	her to go on with her contracts with the Berlin movie producers.
	“The parting of the ways came one night a few months
	.after we were married,” she said, “when I was making one of
	my periodic stays at Count Dombski’s castle at Sassnowiece, in
	Poland. A telegram arrived about midnight, calling me back to
	the Berlin studio, and when I showed it to my husband he flew
	into a violent rage.
	“Drawing his revolver, he told me that if I left for Berlin
	it would be over his dead body. Knowing how he felt about the
	matter, I recalled that the climax had been reached and that he
	might do something desperate. So I told him 1 would remain.
	“But that night, after he had gone to sleep, I got up and
	dressed and, taking only such clothes as I could carry in my
	arms, I left the castle, never to return.
	“How I reached the railway station at Sassnowiece after my
	escape is still a mystery to me. I must have walked and run
	miles in the darkness. But my mind was made up—my career
	came first, cost what it may. And, as luck would have it, there
	was a train for Berlin almost ready to depart when I arrived
	at the station —the spot where our romance had begun nearly
	a year before.” ...
	The lady who says she is no longer Countess Dombski, and is
	eager to be Mrs. Charles Chaplin, is most emphatic on the
	points at issue between her and the Count. “I deny that I
	am the wife of the Count, and I challenge him to try to assert
	his supposed rights in any court in the world. I have the
	proper decree dissolving the marriage,” she insists.
	“I am told that it is in proper form in all respects, and
	that there is nothing to bind me to the Count. I am as free
	as ever I,was, and he cannot stop me marrying the man of
	Great Britain Bights Uesrrved.

	of my choice.
	“Charlie and I love each other. We are made for eatfl
	other, and we intend to seek happiness together < until death '
	alone parts us. .Charlie sought me out among the artists of tho
	world, and helped me to achieve greater fame than 1 enjoyed
	up to then. We found that we were not only soul mates, but
	that we had the temperament in our art that made tho one
	Tthe complement of the other, and we both think that In associa
	tion we can achieve our greatest and best work.”
	At Los Angeles she appears everywhere Charlie is to bo
	seen, and goes around with the triumphant air of the woman
	in possession who will not surrender her rights to the film
	artist under any circumstances.
	“There is no law that can keep us apart,” she says. “Wo
	are masters of. our own fate, and we shall not be prevented
	from uniting our lives by ahy one. I love only Charlie in tho
	world. He is my ting among men, and I will marry him in
	spite of everything and everybody who tries to come between
	us all.”
	Mr. Chaplin is less defiant, and at times has the appearance
	of being uncomfortable under the aggressive manner in which
	he is claimed as her- affinity by the lady who seems to have
	discovered in him the perfect lover immediately after he found
	in her the perfect film star.
	Mlle. Pola Negri, when questioned regarding the suggestion
	that she as a Roman Catholic could hardly claim the right to
	remarry after divorce, replied rather vaguely:
	“On that there is a good deal of misunderstanding. I can
	only tell you that I have taken the best -advice from legal and
	spiritual advisers, and there is no real barrier to our marriage
	if we decide to go through with it. •
	“Fate brought Charlie and' me into contact, and we should
	be foolish to run pway from our happiness decreed by fate.
	He was on his way back to America when he was shown a
	film in which I appeared.
	“He said to,the person who showed the film, ‘Why, this is
	the artiste I have been looking for since I first went into the
	film business.’ I received a telegram soon after asking if I
	would meet him.
	“I did not know him except by name, and I did not think
	I should like him, so I said ‘No.’ But in spite of that he came
	and I realized at once that he was altogether different to what
	I had expected, for not only was he a great actor but he was
	a real man in every sense of the word.
	“I found myself won over by his charming manners, and I
	felt that I had at last found the man to whose keeping I could
	surrender, my heart, my life, and my future happiness without
	hesitation. Working with him makes a great deal of difference
	to me.
	“I feel that I can give a better expression to my heart
	under his eyes, and for his sake I try to surpass anything I
	have ever done before. I used to think that Charlie was fust
	what you call a clown, with no art and no message, but now I
	know that behind his clowning there is a real art and a real
	message, if only those who see nis films would understand them.
	“Charlie seeks to portray the- life of ‘Les of
	the great cities and to arouse the comfortable classes to their
	duties and responsibilities to the less fortunate.”
	The story of the beginning of the Chaplin-Negri romance
	is very interesting.
	Charlie was shown some, of the films of the lady in London
	and again in Paris. He liked them so well that he must needs
	rush to Berlin and then to Vienna to see the artiste for himself.
	“A veritable queen of the movies, the most perfect acting
	features I ever seen, capable of expressing every con
	ceivable shade of emotion with the skill and grace of the true
	artiste,” he exclaimed.
	These were among the eulogies passed by Charlie on the
	lady as an artiste, but later he had something to say of her as
	a worn in, as a beauty, and as a charmer of hearts. * She has
	all the qualities of form and soul that fit a woman to reign
	over the heart of a man and to be his greatest inspiration in
	whatever he regards as his life work,” he declared. I
	And Pola Negri was no less lavish in what She said of
	Charlie. “A man that any woman could love, could work with
	as life partner, and feel honored in doing so, finding her true
	happiness in association with his life.,” she declared.
	“He has the true soul of an artiste and is an ideal lover
	with the capacity for making even the most capricious woman
	happy,” were among the things she said of him, and after
	this semi-public love-making, it was only to be expected that
	the rapturous crowds of admirers should be eager to lead the
	happy pair to the altar in order that their lives might be united
	for better or for worse. . . . ,
	Will Count Dombski cool off and let things take their course
	or will he turn up in America and ask Charlie Chaplin to meet
	him on the field of honor? And then what?</text>

	His twenty-eighth home run for tho season cleared the top of the right field
	grandstand, the longest hit that was ever seen since the days when the

	<text>Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin
	ipai slugger in major league baseball these day?, has recently given
	ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
	e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
	ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
	;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
	ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
	?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
	ra club unless his wishes are granted.
	. Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
	alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
	?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
	oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
	Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
	e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
	Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
	'?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
	?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.
	The Joke of the sltuatioa is that

	Manhattan Tribe Purchase Home Run Slug

	In History of Baseball.
	Boston, Jan. 5.?"Babe" Ruth, world champion home-run player
	of the Red Sox, has been bought by the New York Yankees, ac
	cording to an announcement made tonight. Harry H. Frazee, owner
	of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
	price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
	The deal was said to have involved no other players.
	Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon "inside
	information," placed the figure at which "Babe" Ruth was told at
	,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
	substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
	figure was not far from correct.
	Highest Figure Yet Paid.
	If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
	vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
	sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
	a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
	a player.
	When Alexander and Killifer were traded from Philadelphia to
	Chicago, $55,000 changed hands. The greatest price paid for a single
	player up to the trading of Ruth was said to have been the $50,000
	given for Tris Speaker when he went from the Red Sox to Cleveland.</text>

	All these tilings doubtless have some

	thl:- iii.<yionn'nal series of home runs sci
	i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to
	his work with the bat certain well-known
	principles of physics and psychology.
	"But." you say. "Iluth Is a ball plavor.
	What does ho know of physics or psy
	chology?"
	Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
	sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies
	certain well-known principles of these two
	sciences every time ho makes a homo run.
	Let us consider some of the many inter
	rsting scientific factors involved in bat
	t itig a ball.
	As < very follower of baseball knows, a
	home run is the knocking of the ball out
	of the reaoli of opposing players and in
	.r.uch a direction and to nuch a distance as
	<o make its return impossil'o before th?
	runner completes the circuit of the bases.
	Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit
	ting of a home run moans simply hitting
	t)i< ball with the bat so as to give it great
	speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
	and direction which the bat can To made to
	give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
	curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
	the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
	of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
	bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
	pinges on the bat.
	The speed which a ball t * es on im
	mediately after its collision w'th the bat
	is a little difficult to compete because
	neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
	elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
	trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
	let mo explain what happens when per
	fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
	bodies come into collision.
	If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
	of lead?of equal weight and going with
	equal speed, but in opposite directions
	meet squarely "in mid-air, they will both
	stop and fall to the ground, all theii
	energy of motion having been turned into
	heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
	of the same weight going with the same
	velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
	in mid-air, they will bounce back with
	the same velocity they had originally. 11
	one of these bodies has twice the velocity
	of the other, the latter will bounce back
	with twice its original velocity and tho
	former will bounce back only half as fast.
	All this applies to bodies having tho same
	weight. Whenever one of the colliding
	bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
	locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
	is enormously increased.
	The bat which "Rabe" Ruth wields and
	the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
	tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
	the ball will be driven farther the heavier
	the bat and the faster the bat is moving
	as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
	"Halm" Ruth's body prevents his bat from
	doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
	ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
	hits it.
	The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
	important factor in hitting a homo run,
	viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

	were no atmosphere, everytliine be
	ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
	ho the farther it would go. The friction of
	the air. however, slows the ball up con
	siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
	into consideration with several others.
	The conclusion which science reaches Is
	that the heavier tho ball is, without In
	creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
	ticity, tho farther it will go after being
	struck with tho bat.
	The direction taken by a batted ball is
	affected to some extent by the rotation of
	tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
	is of the neatest importance when the
	but does not strike tho ball squarely.
	It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
	in such a way that it actually increases the
	latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
	fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
	ball in such a way that it takes on a de
	cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
	knows what a common occurrence this is
	on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
	dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
	weirdest imaginable path through the air,
	particularly if it passes through various
	air currents.
	A honr n depends to a very large ex
	tent up> ? direction given the batted
	ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
	he estimated a- nine times that of tho
	speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
	we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
	also the vertical angle at which tho ball
	leaves the hat. For example, no matter
	how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
	sult in a home run unit's ."t clears the
	upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
	field.
	It is plain that the direction given
	the butted ball must depend to a largo
	extent upon the manner in which the ball
	is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
	vided the ball is given a proper rota
	tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
	the kind of curve best suited to make it
	difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
	angle is either tho down shoot or the up
	shoot. On account of the many variablo
	factors concerned science believes that any
	home run made with either of theso curve3
	is a lucky chance pure and simple.
	After the ball has boon set in motion by
	the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
	it will go depends upon the vertical angle
	at which it starts. The most desirable
	angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
	or about half a right angle. Other factors
	which determine the distance a batted ball
	will travel are the speed of the ball, its
	sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
	and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
	speed of the ball tho more perfectly
	spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
	and the less rotation with which it travels
	the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
	ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
	A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
	free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
	it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
	its progress.
	If science wore asked to make it difficult
	or well-nigh impossible for "Babe" Kutli to
	Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
	tho barometer was high, with the air so
	heavy with moisture that it would retard
	the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
	pitcher selected would be one good on very
	alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
	pitcher were not available, one who hid
	euch great speed that lie couid put any
	kind of a ball over the plato for tho
	batter would bo chosen. With this
	hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
	be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
	started on its course at the proper angle.
	His hitting of a homo run could then bo
	mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
	redoubtable "Babe" to use a bat either so
	heavy that he could not swing it with much
	speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
	tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
	There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
	ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
	ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
	knows as the centre of percussion. If the
	ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
	greatest effect is produced. All ball play
	ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
	on the bat, not only through the absence
	of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
	iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
	but which is no doubt physical as well as
	mentnl.
	"Babe" Ruth's phenomenal home run rec
	ord is largely due to tho fact that, con
	sciously or unconsciously, he has found a
	way of producing the collision between
	his bat and tho ball on this centre of per
	cussion more frequently than any other
	player.
	What is called the centre of percussion
	is a principle that enters into the design
	not only ot baseball bats, but of all things
	designed for men to swing. In the ham
	mer, for example, the centre of percussion
	should be in the head. If the tool is not
	designed so that this centre is properly
	located the hammer is unsatisfactory to
	use because it jars and tires tho am too
	much.
	The problem of hitting homo runs with
	the surprising frequency that "Babe" Ruth
	does is ono more complicated in the mat
	ter of powers of Judgment and observa
	tion involved than in mechanical prin
	ciples. Viewed as a mechanical problem,
	tho home run requires a bat just as heavy
	as a player can use with comfort, tho bat
	to bo given a motion as fast as possible
	when hitting the ball, and striking the
	ball so that it wilt ho impelled into tho
	air at an anglo of approximately 42 de
	grees or half a right angle. The ball
	should also, of course, be hit at such a
	horizontal angle as not to cause a foul.
	T^lio weight of the batter has very little
	to do with tho matter of home runs, hut his
	arm muscles are a controlling factor to
	the extent of, say, fifty per cent. Of course,
	If his arms are rigid enough to make tho
	bat for all practical purposes a part of his
	body when he hits the ball, and if his body
	is swung forward at just that instant, it
	Is possible that a heavy batter, all other
	things being equal, would be able to knock
	the ball farther than a lighter player.

	To follow tho ball as it leaves the pitcher's
	hand is no easy matter, as tho sphere is
	often travelling at the rate of lf>0 feet
	a second, or nearly two milos a minuto.
	The eye movement necessary to follow it
	increases greatly as tho ball draws nearor
	and nearer the plato, owing to tho in
	crease in the angle of vision which, by the
	time the ball is over tho plate, is about
	ten times what it was when it left tho
	pitcher's hand.
	As 1 have said, tho pitcher often hurls
	the ball at the rato of 150 feet a second.
	But tho ball is travelling much faster
	than that when it leaves "Babe" Ruth's bat
	after being hit for one of tho home runs
	that have made him famous. This is in
	accordance with the laws of tho impact of

	farther it will bounce

	Of courso, If it Is raining
	when one of "Babe" Ruth's
	long hits is made, the
	drops of water striking tho
	ball will bring it to the
	ground long before it
	otherwise would fall. Tho
	rain also makes the ball
	heavier, and as It contains
	only so much energy to
	k start with, it will bo
	\ slowed up in its flight on
	account of some of tho
	L?rIL.? energy being used to give

	flow much actual energy does "Babe"
	Ruth expend in hitting one of his home
	fns? Tho activity or horsepower involved
	1* very great, but it is in operation only
	for tho" fraction of a second.
	The ball which "liabe" Ruth hits for a
	V e run weighs about tivo ounces. If
	n % at gives it a velocity of 500 feet a see
	on.., wo find, by applying a well known
	formula of physics, that 1,200 foot pounds
	of actual energy or work is done. Now,
	if it takes Ruth one-twentieth of a second
	to impart this energy by a swing of his bat,
	this would be at tho rate of 24,000 foot
	pounds a second, which is about forty-four
	horsepower.
	Tho king of homo run makors Is then
	working at tho rate of forty-four horse
	power evory time ho cracks out one of hla
	long hits, but he maintains this rate for
	such a brief length of time i.hat not very
	much actual work is involved.

	up to (lato coulil ho collected into a singlo

	Twenty-nine such runs last season and

	this would he the equivalent of more than
	2,000-horsepower?enough if exerted bo
	hind a gigantic bat to demolish a building
	like Now York's Metropolitan Tower!
	Of course, there are many psychological
	as well as mechanical factors involved in
	the hitting of tho long scries of home runs
	which "Babe" Ruth has been making for
	two seasons. The batter must bo able to
	"sense" in some manner not yet fully un
	derstood just about what kind of ball the
	pitcher is going to throw. Then he must bo
	capable of putting his body in readiness
	with lightning swiftness to meet that kind
	of ball when it passes over the plate. Tho
	player's Judgment about tho bull must bo
	made within tho smallest fraction of a sec
	ond after it leaves tho pitchpr's hand.
	Through some queer sixth sense?tne
	kinaesthotic sense, as psychologists call it
	?all batters have tho feeling as to whether
	the trnll tho pitcher is about to throw is go
	ing to pass over the plato or not. In tho
	average batter the impressions conveyed
	by this sixth sense caunot be more than (50
	per cent accurate, but in the case of "Babe"
	Ruth, as his batting record shows, they
	must be about 90 per cent accurate. As
	everybody who plays baseball or ever
	watches a game knows, you can't strike out
	and make a homo run. and the player can
	seldom hit a home run unless the bail ha
	strikes is taking a course that would havo
	carried it straight across the plate unless
	Interrupted by his bat.
	This, then, is the secret of "Babe"
	Ruth's home runs as viewed from a scien
	tist: standpoint. A highly developed kin
	aesthetic sense enables him to "sense" the
	kind of ball the pitcher is going to throw.
	When a ball rotating on Its horizontal
	n.\is and curving most favorably for his
	purpose comes along he swings his bat at
	it with an energy sufficient to chango its
	direction and greatly increase its velocity.

	"Did Babe Ruth Get Another One To-day?"
	| Not "How Did the Game Come Out?"
	*| Now the Great American Question 4
	<
	By W? O. McGeehan
	IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
	peare were a' baseball writer he
	might usa a line that he
	wested upon some more or less
	obscure hero of antiquity and say of
	"Babe" Ruth, "He doth bestride the
	narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
	sus." For "Babe" Ruth is Hercules
	and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
	of Swat. His bat is the club of
	Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
	the symbol of sheer, primitive might
	before which the puny folk bow and
	offer worship.
	But for the game of baseball, the
	youngest game of the youngest peo?
	ple, George Herman Ruth, the
	"Babe" Ruth who dwarfs all other
	personalities in the daily news,
	might have been a peaceful cigar
	maker or perhaps a third-rate
	heavyweight pugilist instead of the
	national idol of the American people.
	The "Babe" was Fortune's dar?
	ling, though Fortune concealed her
	great and kindly intentions as far as
	he was concerned when the "Babe"
	was 2. boy. For the "Babe" was
	born left-hander!. Hercules was a
	right-hander. Thor never was pic?
	tured as wielding his hammer from
	the port side. None of the heroes of
	antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
	tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
	Wilson was the first novelist to put a
	left-hander in the near-hero class,
	and he <i;d it in a half-hearted
	fashion.
	Moreover, little George Herman
	Ruth was a half-orphan at a very
	early age and was sent to an insti?
	tution for orphans. He was nearly
	an orphan boy, and, according to
	the San ford and Merton books, he
	should have taken a morbid sort of
	point of view at an early age and
	learned something useful. But the
	youth of "Babe" Ruth was applied
	mostly to the study of the great
	American game of baseball.
	You are not going to draw any
	conventional moral from the early
	boyhood of "Babe" Ruth. He was
	not a particularly industrious or
	thrifty lad, chockful of conventional
	virtues. He was just a normal,
	chuckle-headed combination of Tom
	Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He
	Was Just natural and just human.
	FORTUNATELY the boyhood of
	"Babe" Ruth was intrusted to
	men who understand human
	nature, and particularly the human
	boy?the Christian Brothers, of Bal?
	timore. The fraternity is not limited
	to Baltimore. It is all over the
	*orld. It is made up of big-hearted
	?fcn. consecrated to the work of mak
	lfig men out of the raw material.
	They had charge of the bringing
	UP of George Herman Ruth and
	'hey have turned over to the world
	??Colossus of Swat. It is due to
	th*ir human understanding that
	George Herman Ruth was not
	wwarted and turned aside into more
	Wo**ic iine8 0f encjeavor,
	U?Kt lana&tiQ than ?sqr *rf fbe
	I boy romances of Tattered Tom and
	Ragged Dick, by Horatio Alger jr.
	; is the rise of "Babe" Ruth. The Al-,
	| ger heroes became mere bankers or
	traction magnates, but George Her
	| man Ruth, the waif of Baltimore, be?
	came "Babe" Ruth, at whose shrine
	' bankers and traction magnates burn
	incense. Ever and anon these jaded
	near-successes pick up the tape, not
	to see the condition of the market,
	but to learn whether the latest is the
	forty-fifth or forty-sixth home run
	! knocked out by the "Babe" for the
	I season.
	And these heroes envy "Babe"
	! Ruth the left-handed, the boy who
	! was regarded as far from bright in
	;his classes. For the "Babe" can hit
	them out with the joyous freedom of
	Hei-culcs swinging his club or Thor
	throwing his hammer through the'
	clouds. All the tricks of the pitchers
	are vain when he faces them, and all
	the walls of the baseball parks are
	lowered when his bat crashes against
	the baseball. Homer would have
	loved him if the blind singer had had
	a season pass to the Polo Grounds.
	THAT Ruth is the greatest bat?
	ter of them all is admitted by
	two members of the old Orioles;
	and when two members of the old
	Orioles agree upon anything, that
	makes it official and irrefutable. If
	there is anybody so ignorant of im?
	portant American history that he
	does not know who the old Orioles
	are, we will explain, more in pity
	than in indignation, that the old
	Orioles were members of the great?
	est baseball team of a generation or
	so ago.
	The two Orioles who made the ad?
	mission that "Babe" Ruth was the
	greatest baseball player in the whole
	world are Wilbert Robinson, mana?
	ger of the Brooklyn National League
	baseball team, and Joseph Kelly,
	scout for the Yankees. Both of these
	gentlemen are grandfathers and citi?
	zens of high repute in the city where
	they dwell, which also happens to i
	be the home of "Babe" Ruth. "Wil-1
	bert Robinson was a catcher, and still
	; holds the world's record for consecu?
	tive base hits in one game. Joseph
	Kelly was an outfielder of sorts on
	the old Orioles, and his present oc-1
	cupation is "ivory hunting," looking
	upon baseball playera and appraising
	them ?at their true > jrtb to their
	employers and to the national pas?
	time.
	These two authorities admitted" to
	me in th? presence of witnesses that
	never, even in the days of the old
	Orioles, was there a baseball player
	who could hit like "Babe" Ruth. Con?
	sider the importance of this admis?
	sion. The members of the old Ori?
	oles are the most conservative per?
	sons in th vorld. Never before
	have they au. : ..ed that any player
	of the present was anywhere near as
	wonderful as tl\e players of their
	glorious day.
	"He can hit them harder than any?
	body, and he can hit them oftener,"
	they admitted from the fullness of
	their hearts. They did not qualify
	the statement, They did ?ob assert
	that the pitchers were less canny
	and that the ball parks were smaller.
	They admitted that the heroes of
	their day were lost in the shadow of
	the Colossus of Swat. They admitted
	that even in the days when the old
	Orioles were young "Babe" Ruth
	would have loomed up above them
	all.
	That Ruth broke all big league
	records for home run getting last
	year is in the book. That he has
	broken his own record this year and
	is on the way to setting a mark far
	beyond the misty horizons ?if the
	baseball world is l?o\vn. But the
	old Orioles have explained away the
	performances of other more modern
	heroes of baseball. Ruth's achieve?
	ments they Jr&ott ungrudgingly.,
	That is almost as marvelous as the
	achievements themselves.
	.
	ONCE upon a time the youth of
	this land worshiped another
	young giant, a right-hander
	and an exponent of another and el?
	der sport?John L. Sullivan. The
	right arm of John L. ?Sullivan was
	mighty in its day, but the left arm i
	of "Babe" Ruth is mightier in its I
	day and generation in the matter of
	sheer numbers of worshipers.
	| They used to block the corridors
	of the hotels, and even the streets,1
	? to see the mighty John L. pass. They
	do that in the case of "Babe" Ruth,
	I too. It is not for me to disparage
	| the memory of John L. Sullivan, the
	| gladiator, in th? days-cf hi? greatest
	-?
	ring glory, but I think, that his ad?
	mirers saw that particular John L.
	through rose glasses and that they
	worshiped an illusion.
	The John L. Sullivan of the later !
	day, the John L. who beat down his ?
	own worst enemy and lifted up his ;
	self-respect from the muck, was the
	John L. that should have been wor- ;
	shiped, for that John L. Sullivan :
	was a mighty gladiator. The John ,
	L. Sullivan who knocked out ring an- j
	tagonists with a right-hand punch to j
	the jaw was a mere mass of brawn ?
	and muscle, but the gray and fat old |
	John L. who conquered himself was i
	the true fighter.
	But we are considering the John L.
	that was the popular idol, the '
	brawny man who was followed by '
	the men and the boys and cheered
	when he stalked abroad. He was !
	not a particularly affable character.
	This big "Babe" Ruth is a far
	more likable person. He is full of i
	good nature and the joy of living.
	He is a modest enough young man, :
	and he knows his limitations, though ;
	he acknowledges no limitations as j
	far as the baseball diamonds and j
	the fences around them are con
	cerned. He is not falsely modest to
	the point of affectation, for he has
	that supreme confidence in himself
	that comes after certain achievement.
	But he will not play to the gallery
	consciously. He likes the gallery
	and he understands it, and he likes
	to have it understand him. ?
	Ruth is, perhaps, too simple, or
	it may be too wise, to try to fool his
	gallery, as other stars of his own ;
	game or stars in other lines of en?
	deavor have tried to do in vain. For
	nobody can fool his gallery. No
	truly wise man ever tried.
	THE best judges of a man ar?
	the men with whom he works !
	or with whom he plays.
	"Babe" Ruth, naturally, is the high?
	est salaried ballplayer on the New
	York Yankees. He might, if he were
	like some of the stars of baseball or i
	stars of some of the arts, claim all
	the privileges of a star and hold
	himself aloof from his fellow players.
	Here again is the simplicity or the
	wisdom of "Babe" Ruth. He plays
	the game with the team and for the
	team, and the men ' he plays with
	know it and appreciate it. "Babe'
	Ruth will even make the "college
	try" to get a base on an impossible
	chance. The "cdllege try" is the vet?
	eran professional's term of contempt
	for zealous endeavor that seems fu?
	tile on the facts of it.
	_ an the "Babe" *nake?th? two
	owners of the Yankees, Colonels I
	Ruppert and Huston, shudder with !
	apprehension when he hurls himself
	against a wall to get a fly ball, or I
	when he throws his huge bulk
	through the air in the effort to steal i
	a base. They rejoice in his spirit
	and his wholehearted way of play?
	ing, but at the same time they per?
	spire with apprehension lest some?
	thing should happen that would de?
	prive them of the most expensive in?
	vestment in professional baseball.
	Some stars have disrupted base?
	ball teams, rousing jealousies, but
	"Babe" Ruth, admittedly the great?
	est star of them all, has made the
	Yankees a team. The advent of the
	"Babe" has brought them the chance
	of that "world's scries dough," which
	should be something like $7,000 a
	player. It has also made them the
	team of the big leagues. They do not
	begrudge the "Babe" the homage
	that is paid him. As far as Ruth
	is concerned, there is no professional
	jealousy on the Yankee team.
	Just to what extent the present
	prosperity of professional baseball
	is due to "Babe" Ruth I would not
	care to say, but it is considerable
	When I first trailed West with tht
	Yankees, they told me in Chicagc
	that there had been little or no in
	tereat in the Chicago White Sox. Bu
	I when the Yankees came ta Cbicagi
	they turned out to the extent of 20,
	000 a day and upward to see the
	"Babe" "bust one."
	Once, with the score 2 to 1 in the
	eighth and a tense pitchers' duelen,
	the Chicago pitcher passed "Babe"
	Ruth. Ten thousand people started
	to walk out of Comiskey Park.
	There remained yet the chance of
	the melodramatic ninth inning rally,
	but the ten thousand had lost all
	interest in the game for the after?
	noon. It was clear thatr they were
	not going to see "Babe" Ruth knock
	a home run, and nothing else mat?
	tered.
	Civic pride, inter-city rivalry, in?
	terest in the national game were
	minor considerations. The "Babe"
	was not due to "bust one."
	IN CLEVELAND 1 was talking
	to two tired business men early
	in the afternoon.
	Said one of them gravely:
	"This 'Babe' Ruth is a menace. He
	is responsible to a large degree for
	i the lack of production in these
	: manufacturing towns around the
	Lakes. Go out to the ball park to?
	day and you will see thousands of
	young men taking the afternoon off
	just to see 'Babe' Ruth 'bust one.'

	<text>"BABE" RIJTH'S SALARY
	"Babe Ruth," baseball star, is to receive a
	salary of seventy-five thousand dollars this year,
	with an additional five hundred dollars for every
	home run he bats out. On the basis of his last
	season's record this should bring his income for
	the coming eight, months' work up to well over the
	hundred thousand dollar mark.
	To many this will seem arf^rtjtf^Sbe. Thej^-will
	point out the fact that the President of the United
	States draws only seventy-five thousand dollars a
	year that the Secretary of State gets but twelve
	jthousand that the salaries of most of our gover
	in&rs and college'presidents average around ten
	thousand dollars a year. These are vocations that
	require years of training, of research, and the
	hardest kind of work.
	Yet, along comes a baseball swatter with no
	special intelligence, and gobbles up a salary great-: h^f^I VutyT
	er than that attached to the greatest office in the
	land.
	Critics of "Babe" Ruth's salary should not for­
	get that thley are living in America. This is a
	j.free land and it offers opportunity for advance
	jment to every citizen. What better proof is need­
	ed than these very facts albout "Babe" Ruth. An
	orphan, with no parents to guide his steps and yet
	with all his handicaps he is raised to the seats of
	the mighty,' with a salary that exceeds those of
	the mighty.
	It cannot be luck. Ruth 'has specialized. He
	has trained. He has made himself the ibaseball
	swat king of America. His name is known from
	coast to coast. His admirers are legion.
	America cannot cry down the salary "Babe"
	Ruth gets. His work is measured by his follow­
	ers, and it is the people who indirectly pay him.
	He is the best in his field. America offers sim­
	ilar opportunities in every line to every citizen,
	and should not be afraid to boast of it. As Emer­
	son so aptly put it a generation ago:
	"If you can make a better mousetrap than your
	neighbor, the world will make a beaten pathway
	to your door."—Minneapolis Journal,

	BABE RUTH LIKELY TO DRAW PENALTY FOR EFFORT TO PROTECT HIMSELF
	WASHINGTON TIMES SPORTS
	FRIDAY, MAY 26, 1922.
	F
	Suspension Likely for Ruth,
	But Incident Draws Attention
	to Fans' Cowardice.
	By lolls A. HOLGHKR.
	Babe Ruth is likely to he pun
	ished severely for entering the
	grandstand at the Polo Grounds,
	New York, and seeking to ham
	mer an insulting fan. There are
	two sides to every question and
	the ball player has an excellent
	argument to offer in partial pal
	liation of his offense.
	Ban Johnson is expected to sus
	pend the Yankees' home-run hit
	ter for ten days. He may impose
	a heavy fine on the player. But
	Ban Johnson will do the game a
	great good if he will investigate
	conditions surrounding the inci
	dent at the Polo Grounds.
	It Is admitted that Babe Ruth
	ov?rratepped the hounds on the play
	ing field when, called out stretching
	his single, he tossed a handful of
	dirt at Umpire Hildebrand. He wps |
	ejected from the game for that, then ?
	and there.
	It is admitted that Ruth commiited
	a cardinal offense when he lef< the I
	playing field and sought to beat up |
	one of his insulters. He is vet to.
	be punished for that.
	Nevertheless\ Bah* Rulli and |
	every other player In ihe ma.ntr
	leagues is entitled io prole? limi
	from insult and injury on the par!
	of the public. It is all tnirutivrnt
	for a club owner to say he cannot
	stop the Rood of villifi? at ion such
	as we heard shouted at Rulli yes
	terday snd Wednesday.
	?
	Babe Ruth is a young man. He ?
	la lio better anil no worse ih.in any
	?ther man.
	Babe Ruth, because he can hit I
	home runs, has been raised on a
	pinnacle extending wcllnigh lo tho ?
	skies. If it has turned his h?ed. |
	there ia good reason.
	Babe Ruth, be? atise he has not *
	been hitting home runs in every !
	game since his return to the New
	Tork lineup, ha? been the tarnet ;
	for Insults shocking to one not ac- I
	customed to them.

	Ban Expresses Sorrow
	For Ruth's Wild
	Deed on Field
	CHICAGO, May 26.?"I am
	sorry to hear that," waa the
	comment of Ban Johnson,
	American League president,
	when informed that Ruth had
	kicked over the traces in yes
	terday's Yankee-Senator game
	at the Polo Grounds in New
	York.
	Johnson was unable to say
	what action .he would take in
	the matter. He will be guided
	by what Umpires Nallin and
	Hildebrand have to say in their
	telegraphic reporta of the af
	fair.
	insult rose to Its height In the
	seventh Inning .when Ruth fail???! to
	hit safely, with two out and the
	bases loaded.
	In yesterday's game the chorur of
	"boos" began with his first appear
	ance at the plate. His sacrifico bunt
	only added fuel to the fire.
	No man pun>_u_Ug a ticket in
	a ball game haa any inherent right
	to Insult the player? with woids
	he would not dare use were he
	anywhere else. It is the duty of
	the umpire to rail attention of this
	situation to the club owner, li la
	the latter's duty to take such
	measures as will halt the Insults.
	I_cking such protection by bolli
	umpire and magnate, the player
	may be expected to do something
	in his own, defense, even when that
	action is distinctly against the ruirs
	of the league. His action may not
	be justified under those rules, but
	to the average man they are entire
	ly Justifiable.
	Ruth committed a cardinal offense
	when he climbed Into the ?tauri.
	Those fans make It possible for
	him to be the highest-paid liall
	player in the business.. Without
	those fans, there would be no bute
	ball played at all, save as a matter
	of exercise.
	if Ruth were an ancient phil
	osopher, he might sit down, swallow
	his chagrin at the turn ln the tide
	and wait for better days. But Ruth
	is a young man. a professional
	athlete raised in one season to the
	heights of popular success. He Is
	maklnii more money than dozens of
	men together. It is but natura.] for
	him to he shocked at what has
	happened since he returned to the
	New Tork lineup.
	If Ruth knew much nf the old
	Athenian Kccle.sia he might
	ponder on the fate of great gen
	erais and ?tatemen at the hands
	?if Ihe mob. He probably never
	Inaid of the t.?'desia. If he did,
	he might not be a ball player.
	He who in lifted to the akiea by
	popular acclaim may be Just as
	easily and even more quickly hurle?!
	into the depths by that same public ?
	Ruth is undergoing such experiente
	now.
	In 1911 Ty Cobb. suffering from
	similar insults, rushed into th?? |
	stund at the Yankees' old Hilltop
	park snd severely chaatlsed a fan
	He was fined and suspended for ten ?
	days, causing a strike on the pert
	of the entire Detroit club. Hox\ -
	ever, the fine and suspenakin stuck
	and the Detroit club was Induced to
	play ball. ? rule was then adopta??!
	by the American league seeking to
	prevent ?a repltition of such sn ai ?.
	Yesterday's affair In New York Is
	the first since 1911. though Harrv
	Courtney attempted to stage such ri
	foolish act st Georgia avenue last
	fall.
	Rahe Ruth is known aa an easy
	going man on the field. He leads
	no riots. He gives all he hss to his
	team on the field. In 1919 he
	swung on Umpire Brick Owens and
	was suspended for five days, but
	that was the one rough act In his
	career until yesterday.

	"Babe" Ruth, whose inability so far this year to start his home run clouting, has caused him no
	end of criticism from the Polo (?round spectators.
	Yesterday this continual rowdyism from the stands got liabe's "goat" snd in the third inning he
	decided to take matters into hi.- own huno!.-, and avenge an insult hurled at him by a cash customer.
	The incident brought about his banishment from the field.
